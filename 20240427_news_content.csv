Millions of people across South and Southeast Asia are facing sweltering temperatures, with unusually hot weather forcing schools to close and threatening public health.Thousands of schools across the Philippines, including in the capital region Metro Manila, have suspended in-person classes. Half of the country’s 82 provinces are experiencing drought, and nearly 31 others are facing dry spells or dry conditions, according to the UN, which has called for greater support to help the country prepare for similar weather events in the future. The country’s upcoming harvest will probably be below average, the UN said.April and May are usually the hottest months in the Philippines and other countries in south-east Asia, but temperatures this year have been worsened by the El Niño event, which brings hotter, drier conditions to the region.Thai authorities said 30 people had been killed by heatstroke so far this year, and warned people to avoid outdoor activities. Demand for electricity soared to a new high on Monday night of 35,830 megawatts, as people turned to air conditioning for relief, local media reported.In the capital Bangkok, temperatures reached 40.1C on Wednesday, while authorities warned of a possible “heat index” of past 52C on Thursday. This measure reflects what the temperature feels like, taking into account humidity levels – an important factor for human health because when the air is more humid, it is harder for the body to regulate its temperature by sweating.On Friday, the Philippines weather agency warned Metro Manila and 31 other areas were predicted to experience dangerous temperatures. The heat index was expected to reach 42C in Quezon City, the most populous city in the country, it said.The unusually high temperatures have caused disruption to education and agriculture across the Asian region. Bangladesh was also forced to close all schools this week after temperatures soared to between 40C and 42C in some areas.About 33 million children in Bangladesh were affected, according to the charity Save the Children. “Leaders need to act now to urgently reduce warming temperatures, as well as factoring children – particularly those affected by poverty, inequality and discrimination – into decision making and climate finance,” said Shumon Sengupta, Country Director Bangladesh, Save the Children International.Thousands of people in Bangladesh have gathered in mosques and rural fields, praying for relief from the heat.In India, where a mammoth election lasting nearly six weeks, is now under way, the election commission met this week with officials from the weather agency to discuss how to mitigate the impact of the heat on voters. The country’s Roads Minister Nitin Gadkari fainted during a speech on Wednesday as he campaigned for the re-election of prime minister Narendra Modi’s government, saying later on social media that he had felt uncomfortable due to the heat during the rally.The World Meteorological Organization warned in a report this week that Asia remained “the world’s most disaster-hit region from weather, climate and water-related hazards in 2023”. Floods and storms caused the highest number of reported casualties and economic losses, it said, while the impact of heatwaves became more severe.Last year, severe heatwaves in India in April and June caused about 110 reported deaths due to heatstroke. “A major and prolonged heatwave affected much of South-east Asia in April and May, extending as far west as Bangladesh and Eastern India, and north to southern China, with record-breaking temperatures,” WMO said.Human-caused climate breakdown is supercharging extreme weather across the world, driving more frequent and more deadly disasters from heatwaves to floods to wildfires. At least a dozen of the most serious events of the last decade would have been all but impossible without human-caused global heating."

A UN-led panel of nearly 100 countries is to draw up new guidelines to prevent some of the environmental damage and human rights abuses associated with mining for “critical minerals”.Mining for some of the key raw materials used in low-carbon technology, such as solar panels and electric vehicles, has been associated with human rights abuses, child labour and violence, as well as grave environmental damage.Cobalt mining, for instance, has led to an upsurge in illegal labour and human rights violations, particularly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Copper mining has also led to severe pollution and environmental damage in some regions.The global supply chain for other critical minerals, such as the rare earths needed for renewable energy production, is also increasingly a matter of concern for governments as they shift their economies to a low-carbon footing.António Guterres, the secretary general of the UN, has gathered a panel of developed and developing countries with interests in the extraction and consumption of critical minerals with instructions to draw up a set of guidelines for the industries.“A world powered by renewables is a world hungry for critical minerals,” said Guterres at the launch of the initiative on Friday. “For developing countries, critical minerals are a critical opportunity, to create jobs, diversify economies, and dramatically boost revenues. But only if they are managed properly.”. Addressing concerns that the scramble for raw materials had been disastrous for some, he said: “The race to net zero cannot trample over the poor. The renewables revolution is happening, but we must guide it towards justice.”. The guidelines drawn up by the panel will only be voluntary and are likely to rely heavily on big companies policing their own supply chains.Laura Kelly, the head of sustainable markets at the International Institute for Environment and Development thinktank, said: “This is a good first step because at the moment, each country is doing its own thing in the rush to lock in access to critical minerals.“But the fact that these will only be voluntary principles means there’ll be no enforcement mechanism for whatever guidelines are developed. In the end, voluntary guidelines are only as good as those willing to commit to them.”. She also noted that there was to be only limited input from Indigenous people, and that local people’s views must be taken into account.The panel, which will produce the first draft of the guidelines ahead of the UN general assembly this September, will be chaired by South Africa and the European Commission.Most of the world’s biggest producers are included on the panel, which comprises 21 countries plus the EU and the African Union, including Australia, Indonesia, Colombia and Chile. Many of the biggest consumers, including China, the US and the UK, are also onboard.Sign up to Down to Earth. The planet's most important stories.

Institutions such as the World Bank, the International Energy Agency, civil society groups and the biggest global trade association for mineral producers, which represents about 40% of the global supply, are also involved. Russia is absent, as are Ecuador, Bolivia, Argentina and many smaller developing countries.The critical minerals they will focus on include copper, lithium, nickel, cobalt and rare earth elements such as yttrium, ytterbium and neodymium. These are essential components for wind turbines, solar panels, electric vehicles and battery storage.Governments agreed last year at the Cop28 climate summit to triple renewable energy generation capacity globally by 2030. Demand for critical minerals is expected to more than triple as a result.Nozipho Joyce Mxakato-Diseko, the South African co-chair of the UN panel on critical energy transition minerals, said there was a gap in the governance of global mineral resources that urgently needed to be filled.“The objective of the panel is to build trust and certainty towards harnessing the potential of these minerals to be utilised to unlock shared prosperity, leaving no one and no place behind,” she said.Ditte Juul Jørgensen, the EU’s director general for energy and the other co-chair, said: “The global energy goals we all agreed at Cop28 require a rapid scale-up in the manufacturing and deployment of renewables globally, and critical energy transition minerals. [We will draw up] principles to ensure a fair and transparent approach globally and for local communities.”. "

Climate experts fear Donald Trump will follow a blueprint created by his allies to gut the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), disbanding its work on climate science and tailoring its operations to business interests.Joe Biden’s presidency has increased the profile of the science-based federal agency but its future has been put in doubt if Trump wins a second term and at a time when climate impacts continue to worsen.The plan to “break up Noaa is laid out in the Project 2025 document written by more than 350 rightwingers and helmed by the Heritage Foundation. Called the Mandate for Leadership: The Conservative Promise, it is meant to guide the first 180 days of presidency for an incoming Republican president.The document bears the fingerprints of Trump allies, including Johnny McEntee, who was one of Trump’s closest aides and is a senior adviser to Project 2025. “The National Oceanographic [sic] and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) should be dismantled and many of its functions eliminated, sent to other agencies, privatized, or placed under the control of states and territories,” the proposal says.That’s a sign that the far right has “no interest in climate truth”, said Chris Gloninger, who last year left his job as a meteorologist in Iowa after receiving death threats over his spotlighting of global warming.The guidebook chapter detailing the strategy, which was recently spotlighted by E&E News, describes Noaa as a “colossal operation that has become one of the main drivers of the climate change alarm industry and, as such, is harmful to future US prosperity”. It was written by Thomas Gilman, a former Chrysler executive who during Trump’s presidency was chief financial officer for Noaa’s parent body, the commerce department.Gilman writes that one of Noaa’s six main offices, the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, should be “disbanded” because it issues “theoretical” science and is “the source of much of Noaa’s climate alarmism”. Though he admits it serves “important public safety and business functions as well as academic functions”, Gilman says data from the National Hurricane Center must be “presented neutrally, without adjustments intended to support any one side in the climate debate”.But Noaa’s research and data are “largely neutral right now”, said Andrew Rosenberg, a former Noaa official who is now a fellow at the University of New Hampshire. “It in fact basically reports the science as the scientific evidence accumulates and has been quite cautious about reporting climate effects,” he said. “It’s not pushing some agenda.”. The rhetoric harkens back to the Trump administration’s scrubbing of climate crisis-related webpages from government websites and stifling climate scientists, said Gloninger, who now works at an environmental consulting firm, the Woods Hole Group.“It’s one of those things where it seems like if you stop talking about climate change, I think that they truly believe it will just go away,” he said. “They say this term ‘climate alarmism’ … and well, the existential crisis of our lifetime is alarming.”. Noaa also houses the National Weather Service (NWS), which provides weather and climate forecasts and warnings. Gilman calls for the service to “fully commercialize its forecasting operations”.He goes on to say that Americans are already reliant on private weather forecasters, specifically naming AccuWeather and citing a PR release issued by the company to claim that “studies have found that the forecasts and warnings provided by the private companies are more reliable” than the public sector’s. (The mention is noteworthy as Trump once tapped the former CEO of AccuWeather to lead Noaa, though his nomination was soon withdrawn.). The claims come amid years of attempts from US conservatives to help private companies enter the forecasting arena – proposals that are “nonsense”, said Rosenberg.Right now, all people can access high-quality forecasts for free through the NWS. But if forecasts were conducted only by private companies that have a profit motive, crucial programming might no longer be available to those in whom business executives don’t see value, said Rosenberg.Sign up to First Thing.

What about forecasts available to farmers that aren’t wealthy farmers? Storm-surge forecasts in communities that aren’t wealthy?” he said. “The frontlines of most of climate change are Black and brown communities that have less resources. Are they going to be getting the same service?”. Private companies like Google, thanks to technological advancements in artificial intelligence, may now indeed be producing more accurate forecasts, said Andrew Blum, author of the 2019 book The Weather Machine: A Journey Inside the Forecast. Those private forecasts, however, are all built on Noaa’s data and resources.Fully privatizing forecasting could also threaten the accuracy of forecasts, said Gloninger, who pointed to AccuWeather’s well-known 30- and 60-day forecasts as one example. Analysts have found that these forecasts are only right about half the time, since peer-reviewed research has found that there is an eight- to 10-day limit on the accuracy of forecasts.“You can say it’s going to be 75 degrees out on May 15, but we’re not at that ability right now in meteorology,” said Gloninger. Privatizing forecasting could incentivize readings even further into the future to increase views and profits, he said.Commercializing weather forecasts – an “amazing example of intergovernmental, American-led, postwar, technological achievement” – would also betray the very spirit of the endeavor, said Blum.In the post-second world war era, John F Kennedy called for a global weather-forecasting system that relied on unprecedented levels of scientific exchange. A privatized system could potentially stymie the exchange of weather data among countries, yielding less accurate results.The founding of weather forecasting itself showcases the danger of giving profit-driven companies control, said Rosenberg. When British V Adm Robert FitzRoy first introduced Britain to the concept of forecasts during Victorian times, he was often bitterly attacked by business interests. The reason: workers were unwilling to risk their lives when they knew dangerous weather was on the horizon.“The ship owners said, well, that means maybe I lost a day’s income because the fishermen wouldn’t go out and risk their lives when there was a forecast that was really bad, so they didn’t want a forecast that would give them a day’s warning,” Rosenberg said. “The profit motive ended up trying to push people to do things that were dangerous … there’s a lesson there.”.

Eastern Africa has experienced heavy rain in recent weeks, with flooding in Kenya, Tanzania and Burundi. About 100,000 people have been displaced or otherwise affected in each country, with 32 reported deaths in Kenya and 58 in Tanzania, alongside damage to farmland and infrastructure.There are also fears that large areas of standing water could give rise to outbreaks of waterborne diseases.The Kenyan capital, Nairobi, has been particularly affected this week. The city usually records about 150mm of rain in April, but has so far had an estimated 200-300mm, with some unofficial weather stations having reported much higher amounts. Flooding spread through the city on Wednesday, with people forced to take refuge on their roofs, where many slept overnight.The increased rainfall is linked to the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), a periodic fluctuation in temperature across the Indian Ocean, similar to the better-known El Niño phenomenon in the Pacific. The IOD is now in a positive phase, during which warmer waters move into western parts of the ocean, accentuating rainfall in eastern Africa.This effect is further intensified when a positive IOD phase coincides with El Niño, as is now the case; a powerful El Niño event that began last June is drawing to a conclusion.Meanwhile, in Europe, after a very warm start to April, in the past week temperatures fall well below normal for all but Iberia and the eastern Mediterranean. In Munich, temperatures peaked at 25C on 14 April, but fell to 3.6C by 23 April. Overnight frosts were fairly widespread across central Europe and the Balkan peninsula between 20 and 25 April, while parts of France, Germany and the Netherlands experienced locally severe frosts with minimum temperatures as low as -6C.The unseasonable temperatures resulted from a large area of high pressure that developed towards the north-west and later the west of Europe, allowing colder air to sink southwards across much of the continent. Cooler conditions in late April are not uncommon, but severe frosts in late spring are rare, and can have significant effects on the agricultural industry.

The former tabloid publisher David Pecker’s testimony in Donald Trump’s criminal trial on Friday presented a granular look into a hush-money scheme which prosecutors allege was meant to sway the 2016 election in the real estate mogul’s favor.But when Trump’s longtime assistant, Rhona Graff, was called to the witness stand, her testimony humanized the trial, reminding the courtroom that at its core, these proceedings center on an adult film actor named Stormy Daniels – as well as a man who is either flawed or fraudulent.A key moment in prosecutor Susan Hoffinger’s questioning of Graff revealed that Trump’s contacts contained an entry for Karen McDougal, along with that of someone else named “Stormy”.Hoffinger asked if she saw Daniels at Trump Tower on one occasion.“I have a vague recollection of seeing her in the reception area on the 26th floor,” she said. To the best of her knowledge, this was sometime before the 2016 presidential election which Trump won.“When you saw her at Trump Tower, did you know she was an adult film actress?” Hoffinger asked.“Yes, I did,” Graff replied.During her cross-examination of Graff, defense attorney Susan Necheles worked hard to downplay Daniels’s presence at Trump Tower. Necheles cast Trump as a man who was so busy that he maybe wasn’t paying enough attention to business records, the alleged falsification of which prompted the prosecution against the former president.“I vaguely recall hearing … that she was one of the people [who] may be an interesting contestant on the show,” Graff said when asked whether Daniels was being considered for a slot on Trump’s television program The Apprentice. “I can’t recall a specific instance where I heard it, it was part of the office chatter.”. Necheles asked, “You understood that she was there to discuss being cast for The Apprentice, correct?”. Graff replied: “I assumed that.”. Necheles then had Graff describe how Trump would occasionally sign checks while he was preoccupied or multitasking. That line of inquiry seemed aimed at establishing that Trump was simply distracted when he signed checks now under prosecutors’ scrutiny.With Pecker, defense attorney Emil Bove’s questions on cross prompted him to in effect say that coverage beneficial to Trump was business as usual, as the ex-president’s legal team tries to chip away at the prosecution’s claim that there was an illicit conspiracy to sway the 2016 race.Pecker was instrumental in coordinating three hush-money payments that were made during the 2016 election campaign to quash negative stories about Trump.In cross-examination on his fourth day of testimony, Pecker was grilled by Bove about whether he benefited from running positive stories about Trump and negative stories about other politicians even before the alleged catch-and-kill scheme.Pecker testified that the Enquirer ran negative stories about the Clintons as part of the effort to help the Trump campaign, agreed in a meeting on August 2015.Asked if there were negative articles before the meeting, Pecker said: “That’s correct” and agreed that it was because it made good business sense for the National Enquirer to run articles about the Clintons long before he did so on Trump’s behalf.Bove’s questioning also seemed to try driving wedges into the notion that Trump’s 2006 affair with Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model, was any real threat to Trump’s reputation – apparently suggesting that if she didn’t constitute an actual problem, then giving her money wasn’t meant to influence the election.He admitted that Trump did not pay him any money directly related to McDougal, and that when he first heard about the story he understood that she did not want to publish it. He said he told Trump the same thing when Trump called his office. He also told jurors he understood that McDougal wanted to rekindle her work in magazines.Pecker has testified that American Media Inc (AMI), the publisher of the National Enquirer, paid $30,000 to a former Trump Tower doorman who claimed Trump had a child out of wedlock. Another $150,000 was paid to McDougal.It is the third payment, however, worth $130,000 and paid by Michael Cohen to Stormy Daniels in October 2016, that is at the heart of the case. Prosecutors have charged Trump with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records over: they say Trump illegally marked reimbursements to Cohen for the hush money as payment for Cohen’s legal services.Through yes-or-no questions, which Pecker largely confirmed, Bove on Thursday afternoon had already begun outlining the defense’s argument – namely, that AMI has had a long relationship with Trump, one that began well before the election. Buying stories and not publishing them was also standard for the tabloid.Bove also questioned Pecker’s memory, saying that he listed two different time periods for when he first met Trump about his campaign.“These things happened a long time ago – even when you’re doing your best, and I’m sure you are – it’s hard to remember what people said almost 10 years ago,” Bove said.Earlier in the week, Pecker detailed how he operated as the “eyes and ears” for Trump’s campaign starting in 2015, right after Trump announced his candidacy. He promised Trump and Cohen that he would inform them of any people trying to sell negative stories about Trump.While Pecker seemed eager to help Trump pay off the doorman, he started becoming wary of the hush payments as AMI was working on an agreement with McDougal. The former Playboy model was requesting $150,000 in payment for her story.Pecker said Cohen told him: “I’m your friend, the boss will take care of it.”. Sign up to Trump on Trial.

Pecker was also nervous about potential campaign finance contribution violations, alluding to previous troubles the National Enquirer had when helping the former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger bury stories.Though AMI would ultimately facilitate payments to McDougal, Pecker would decline to reimburse Stormy Daniels directly.“I said I don’t want the National Enquirer to be associated with a porn star,” Pecker said. “This would be very damaging for the magazine, very damaging for American Media.”. Even though the Wall Street Journal would ultimately publish McDougal’s story, and the National Enquirer’s involvement in killing it, four days before the election in November 2016, Trump won the presidency. He would go on to thank Pecker on multiple occasions following his victory.At the end of their questioning, prosecutors asked Pecker if he had any ill feelings toward Trump.“On the contrary,” he said. “I felt that Donald Trump was my mentor. He helped me throughout my career.”. Bove also tried to make distance between Pecker and the Daniels payoff, again in an effort to undermine an alleged conspiracy.Pecker confirmed that he had had a phone call from the then editor-in-chief of the National Enquirer, Dylan Howard, shortly before election day 2016, where he learned about Daniels’s account.“You told Mr Howard that you wanted no involvement with the story, is that correct?” Pecker agreed.“You did not consider Stormy Daniels’s story to be part of any agreement you had in August 2015?” Bove grilled. “You wanted nothing to do with it.”. “That’s right,” Pecker answered.On redirect, prosecutor Joshua Steinglass repeatedly tried to counter Bove’s narrative by eliciting testimony from Pecker indicating that his handling of payoffs was normal tabloid business.Steinglass asked whether a woman’s story about an affair with a married candidate would do well.“That would have been kind of like National Enquirer gold?”. Pecker said yes.But, Steinglass continued: “At the time you had entered into that agreement [with McDougal], you had zero intention of publishing that story?”. Steinglass pressed: “Despite the fact that publishing it would help your bottom line, you killed it to help the candidate, Donald Trump?”. “Uh, yes,” Pecker said.After court adjourns Friday, it is scheduled to resume Tuesday."

In July 1966, as the Beatles were preparing to release Revolver and Spain was approaching the 30th anniversary of the coup that birthed the Franco dictatorship, a Spanish-Filipino artist called Fernando Zóbel threw open the doors of an improbable but visionary cultural outpost.Based in a clutch of 15th-century houses overhanging a precipitous gorge in the small city of Cuenca, the Museo de Arte Abstracto Español, or Museum of Spanish Abstract Art, had a simple if daunting mission. As Manuel Fontán del Junco, the director of museums and exhibitions at the Juan March Foundation in Madrid and one of the curators of a new exhibition about the institution, puts it, “it was a museum for artists in a country of artists without museums”.When Zóbel, who was born to a wealthy and powerful family in Manila, arrived in Spain after studying philosophy and literature at Harvard, he was struck by two things. “When he got here, he realised that the Spanish abstract artists were very good but that they had nowhere to show their works when they came back from international exhibitions,” Fontán said. “He also realised that he could collect their works.”. While Spain was home to an entire generation of globally renowned abstract artists – including Eduardo Chillida, Jorge Oteiza, Manolo Millares and Antoni Tàpies – it had done little to honour them.Zóbel decided to change that by collecting their works and looking for somewhere to show them to the public. A conversation with the painter Gustavo Torner, a native of Cuenca, led to a visit to the city and the discovery that its famous Casas Colgadas (Hanging Houses) had been renovated but were standing empty. Immediately struck by the houses as a possible site for a museum, Zóbel managed to persuade the mayor to let him use the properties in return for a symbolic rent.The museum that opened on 1 July 1966 was not only Spain’s first abstract art museum but also, according to Fontán, the “first artist-run space in Spain, and one of the first in the world”. Although the gallery was hailed by the first director of the Museum of Modern Art in New York as “the most beautiful small museum in the world” – a description that gives the exhibition its title – its importance transcended visual art.As well as showcasing works by the likes of Chillida, Tàpies, Luis Feito and Antonio Saura, the museum operated independently from the cultural framework of the Franco regime and helped transform Cuenca into a hub of artistic production and education.“I think we can almost say that the Cuenca museum was the first democratic museum in the country because it didn’t ask anyone’s permission to do anything,” Fontán said. “It’s true that if it had gone against the regime, it would have been shut down. It was created on the fringes of the Franco regime’s official cultural policy, but it was dreamed into being by a group of artists, led by Zóbel.”. He said Zóbel and his friends, some of whom were clandestine communists, were united by “a shared desire to create a free space with a library and with works of art where people could make the transition to modernity”.“The museum had a massive and very exciting impact: artists came to live in Cuenca; successive generations were weaned on the museum and its library – which has things like Ginsberg’s Howl or the complete works of TS Eliot – and there were also monographs and contemporary art catalogues and essays,” Fontán said.“Just as importantly, there were subscriptions to the important international art magazines of the day, which meant that a little Spanish guy in Cuenca in 1966 could get them. It was easier to get them in Cuenca than in Madrid.”. Zóbel, who would have been 100 this year, donated the museum, its collection and its library to the Juan March Foundation three years before he died in 1984.Fontán said the aim of the show was to tell “the unlikely story of an artist who helped other artists create the first space for modern and contemporary art in our country”.He added that without Zóbel’s trailblazing vision – and without the artists and works and ideas he gathered inside the Hanging Houses almost 60 years ago – Spain would have taken far longer to establish itself as the cultural engine it became after the post-Franco return to democracy.“What Zóbel did allowed Cuenca, this small city, to move ahead 20 or 25 years before the political experiment of the Spanish transition. Let’s say that the institutionality of art in Spain – that world of criticism, fairs, galleries, museums, collections – would have come later if it hadn’t been for this museum.”  . "

He has been called the Nostradamus of US presidential elections. Allan Lichtman has correctly predicted the result of nine of the past 10 (and even the one that got away, in 2000, he insists was stolen from Al Gore). But now he is gearing up for perhaps his greatest challenge: Joe Biden v Donald Trump II.Lichtman is a man of parts. The history professor has been teaching at American University in Washington for half a century. He is a former North American 3,000m steeplechase champion and, at 77 – the same age as Trump – aiming to compete in the next Senior Olympics. In 1981 he appeared on the TV quizshow Tic-Tac-Dough and won $110,000 in cash and prizes.That same year he developed his now famous 13 keys to the White House, a method for predicting presidential election results that every four years tantalises the media, intrigues political operatives and provokes sniping from pollsters. Long before talk of the Steele dossier or Mueller investigation, it all began with a Russian reaching out across the cold war divide.“I’d love to tell you I developed my system by ruining my eyes in the archives, by deep contemplation, but if I were to say that, to quote the late great Richard Nixon, that would be wrong,” Lichtman recalls from a book-crowded office on the AU campus. “Like so many discoveries, it was kind of serendipitous.”. Lichtman was a visiting scholar at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena when he met the world’s leading authority in earthquake prediction, Vladimir Keilis-Borok, who had been part of a Soviet delegation that negotiated the limited nuclear test ban treaty with President John F Kennedy in Washington in 1963.Keilis-Borok had fallen in love with American politics and began a collaboration with Lichtman to reconceptualise elections in earthquake terms. That is, as a question of stability (the party holding the White House keeps it) versus earthquake (the party holding the White House gets thrown out).They looked at every presidential election since Abraham Lincoln’s victory in 1860, combining Keilis-Borok’s method recognising patterns associated with stability and earthquakes with Lichtman’s theory that elections are basically votes up or down on the strength and performance of the party that holds the White House.They came up with 13 true/false questions and a decision rule: if six or more keys went against the White House party, it would lose. If fewer than six went against it, it would win. These are the 13 keys, as summarised by AU’s website:. 1. Party mandate: After the midterm elections, the incumbent party holds more seats in the US House of Representatives than after the previous midterm elections.2. Contest: There is no serious contest for the incumbent party nomination.3. Incumbency: The incumbent party candidate is the sitting president.4. Third party: There is no significant third party or independent campaign.5. Short-term economy: The economy is not in recession during the election campaign.6. Long-term economy: Real per capita economic growth during the term equals or exceeds mean growth during the previous two terms.7. Policy change: The incumbent administration effects major changes in national policy.8. Social unrest: There is no sustained social unrest during the term.9. Scandal: The incumbent administration is untainted by major scandal.10. Foreign/military failure: The incumbent administration suffers no major failure in foreign or military affairs.11. Foreign/military success: The incumbent administration achieves a major success in foreign or military affairs.12. Incumbent charisma: The incumbent party candidate is charismatic or a national hero.13. Challenger charisma: The challenging party candidate is not charismatic or a national hero.Lichtman and Keilis-Borok published a paper in an academic journal, which was spotted by an Associated Press science reporter, leading to a Washington Post article headlined: “Odd couple discovers keys to the White House.” Then, in the Washingtonian magazine in April 1982, Lichtman used the keys to accurately predict that, despite economic recession, low approval ratings and relative old age, Ronald Reagan would win re-election two years later.That led to an invitation to the White House from the presidential aide Lee Atwater, where Lichtman met numerous officials including then vice-president George HW Bush. Atwater asked him what would happen if Reagan did not run for re-election. Lichtman reckoned that a few important keys would be lost, including incumbent charisma.“Without the Gipper, forget it,” Lichtman says. “George Bush is about as charismatic as a New Jersey shopping centre on a Sunday morning. Atwater looks me in the eye, breathes a huge sigh of relief, and says, thank you, Professor Lichtman. And the rest is history.”. For the next election, Bush was trailing his Democratic challenger Michael Dukakis by 18 percentage points in the opinion polls in May 1988, yet Lichtman correctly predicted a Bush victory because he was running on the Reagan inheritance of peace, prosperity, domestic tranquillity and breakthroughs with the Soviet Union.That year Lichtman published a book, The Thirteen Keys to the Presidency. But he was still derided by the punditry establishment. “When I first developed my system and made my predictions, the professional forecasters blasted me because I had committed the ultimate sin of prediction, the sin of subjectivity.“Some of my keys were not just cut and dried and I kept telling them, it’s not subjectivity, it’s judgment. We’re dealing with human systems and historians make judgments all the time, and they’re not random judgments. I define each key very carefully in my book and I have a record.”. He adds: “It took 15 to 20 years and the professional forecasting community totally turned around. They realised their big mathematical models didn’t work and the best models combined judgment with more cut-and-dried indicators. And suddenly the keys were the hottest thing in forecasting.”. Lichtman was a man in demand. He spoke at forecasting conferences, wrote for academic journals and even gave a talk to the CIA about how to apply the 13 keys to foreign elections. And his crystal ball kept working.Sign up to The Stakes — US Election Edition. The Guardian helps you make sense of an unprecedented presidential election. after newsletter promotion. He predicted that George HW Bush would be a one-term president, even though he was riding high in polls after the Gulf war, causing many leading Democrats to pass on mounting a challenge. Then a call from Little Rock, Arkansas. It was Kay Goss, special assistant to Governor Bill Clinton.“Are you really saying that George Bush can be beaten in 1992?” she asked. Lichtman confirmed that he was saying that. Clinton went on to win the Democratic primary election and beat Bush for the White House. “The Clintons have been big fans of the keys ever since,” Lichtman notes.The one apparent blot on Lichtman’s copybook is the 2000 election, where he predicted victory for the Democratic vice-president Al Gore over George W Bush, the Republican governor of Texas. Gore did win the national popular vote but lost the electoral college by a gossamer-thin margin. Lichtman, however, believes he was right.“It was a stolen election. Based on the actual votes, Al Gore should have won going away, except for the discarding of ballots cast by Black voters who were 95% for Gore. I proved this in my report to the United States Commission on Civil Rights. One out of every nine to 10 ballots cast by a Black voter was thrown out, as opposed to one out of 50 cast by a white voter.“Most of those were not so-called hanging chads. They were over-votes because Black people were told punch in Gore and then write in Gore, just to be sure, and those ballots were all discarded. Political scientists have since looked at the election and proved I was right. Al Gore, based on the intent of the voters, should have won by tens of thousands of votes.”. He adds: “I contend I was right about 2000 or at a minimum there was no right prediction. You could argue either way. I contend – and a lot of people agree with me – that I’m 10 out of 10. But even if you say I’m nine out of 10, that’s not bad.”. Perhaps Lichtman’s most striking prophecy, defying polls, commentators and groupthink, was that Trump – a former reality TV star with no prior political or military experience – would pull off a wildly improbable win over the former secretary of state and first lady Hillary Clinton in 2016. How did he know?. “The critical sixth key was the contest key: Bernie Sanders’s contest against Clinton. It was an open seat so you lost the incumbency key. The Democrats had done poorly in 2014 so you lost that key. There was no big domestic accomplishment following the Affordable Care Act in the previous term, and no big foreign policy splashy success following the killing of Bin Laden in the first term, so there were just enough keys. It was not an easy call.”. After the election, Lichtman received a copy of the Washington Post interview in which he made the prediction. On it was written in a Sharpie pen: “Congrats, professor. Good call. Donald J Trump.” But in the same call, Lichtman had also prophesied – again accurately – that Trump would one day be impeached.He was right about 2020, too, as Trump struggled to handle the coronavirus pandemic. “The pandemic is what did him in. He congratulated me for predicting him but he didn’t understand the keys. The message of the keys is it’s governance not campaigning that counts and instead of dealing substantively with the pandemic, as we know, he thought he could talk his way out of it and that sank him.”. In 2020 Lichtman gave a presentation to the American Political Science Association about the keys as one of three classic models of prediction. In recent months he has delivered keynote addresses at Asian and Brazilian financial conferences, the Oxford Union and JP Morgan. As another election looms, he is not impressed by polls that show Trump leading Biden, prompting a fatalistic mood to take hold in Washington DC and foreign capitals.“They’re mesmerised by the wrong things, which is the polls. First of all, polls six, seven months before an election have zero predictive value. They would have predicted President Michael Dukakis. They would have predicted President Jimmy Carter would have defeated Ronald Reagan, who won in a landslide; Carter was way ahead in some of the early polls.“Not only are polls a snapshot but they are not predictors. They don’t predict anything and there’s no such thing as, ‘if the election were held today’. That’s a meaningless statement.”. He is likely to make his pronouncement on the 2024 presidential election in early August. He notes that Biden already has the incumbency key in his favour and, having crushed token challengers in the Democratic primary, has the contest key too. “That’s two keys off the top. That means six more keys would have to fall to predict his defeat. A lot would have to go wrong for Biden to lose.”. Lichtman gives no weight to running mate picks and has never changed his forecast in the wake of a so-called “October surprise” But no predictive model is entirely immune to a black swan event.Speaking in the week that saw a jury seated for Trump’s criminal trial in New York involving a hush-money payment to a pornographic film performer, Lichtman acknowledges: “Keys are based on history. They’re very robust because they go all the way back retrospectively to 1860 and prospectively to 1984, so they cover enormous changes in our economy, our society, our demography, our politics.“But it’s always possible there could be a cataclysmic enough event outside the scope of the keys that could affect the election and here we do have, for the first time, not just a former president but a major party candidate sitting in a trial and who knows if he’s convicted – and there’s a good chance he will be – how that might scramble things.”. Millions of people will be on edge on the night of 5 November. After 40 years of doing this, Lichtman will have one more reason to be anxious. “It’s nerve-racking because there are a lot of people who’d love to see me fail.” And if he does? “I’m human,” he admits. “It doesn’t mean my system’s wrong. Nothing is perfect in the human world.”. Biden v Trump: What’s in store for the US and the world?.

Tunnelling into classic archetypes of masculinity with modern self-awareness is the on-screen niche he has made his own – giving us a new, uniquely supple male star for the post-#MeToo era.

Men want to be him, with his debonair cool and inexhaustible supply of swanky jackets (the leather Miami Vice stunt-team number in The Fall Guy being the latest). As far back as 2017, Morwenna Ferrier noted that Gosling clones, sporting a certain “turbo cleanliness”, were now on the loose in cities everywhere.At the same time, this role model status doesn’t alienate women; in fact, like most well-adjusted male stars in this day and age, he wears his feminist credentials on his perfectly pressed sleeve. Raised by his mother and older sister, he said in 2016: “I think women are better than men. They are stronger, more evolved.” A year later, accepting his Golden Globe for La La Land, he thanked his “lady”, Eva Mendes, for raising their daughters while he was on set. When Robbie and Barbie director Greta Gerwig were overlooked at this year’s Globes, he objected in writing: “There is no Ken without Barbie.”. And crucially his best work services both sexes, often putting him in subordinate roles that like Ken are candid about male frailties. His Officer K in Denis Villeneuve’s Blade Runner sequel looks, like any self-respecting replicant-hunter, like a Raymond Chandler gumshoe. But he is a patsy swept along on narcissistic, all too 21st-century delusions of specialness. (The internet got the hint, memeing his self-righteous “Goddamnit” outburst.). The Fall Guy is more relaxed – but still self-deprecating. With his biceps and blond feather-cut, driving, fighting, falling human multitool Seavers is cut from heart-throb cloth. But he wears this burden like his battered jacket. “I never saw a fist I didn’t remember,” he says after a pummelling. The film’s screenwriter Drew Pearce confirms that Gosling’s adeptness at playing two ends of the spectrum was key to the film: “He’s both authentically masculine, yet also emotionally vulnerable. It’s the best of an old-fashioned movie star like Steve McQueen, with a modern twist of sensitivity. In the movie we play with that dichotomy – his character is a good guy, for sure, but there’s a blind spot in his emotional self-awareness that comes from a very masculine place.”. Undercutting machismo is nothing new, of course: that was the USP of the emerging male stars of 90s New Man-era Hollywood, such as Keanu Reeves, Johnny Depp and Leonardo DiCaprio. But Gosling’s ability to simultaneously affirm and question masculine mores, in films at the very top of his profession, does feel new. His Barbie press tour – lamenting his daughters’ indifference to their Ken dolls, while running with a Kenucopia of terrible puns – was a work of art. This was a man obviously drawing from a deep well of misplaced gender expectations: after being fired up by a childhood viewing of Sylvester Stallone in First Blood, he was suspended from school after lobbing steak knives at fellow pupils. Sly’s habit of wearing minks while directing apparently inspired Ken’s wardrobe.Gosling’s emergence as auto-satirising alpha male is all the more fascinating for the long time it has taken. Not an especial singing or dancing talent, he wasn’t on the same 90s fast track as fellow Mouseketeers Britney Spears, Justin Timberlake and Christina Aguilera. It was 10 more years until his first notable box office success in 2004 weepie The Notebook, his own balsa-wood Titanic. Cast by director Nick Cassavetes for having “no natural leading man qualities”, he was an engrossing mess opposite his love rival, the more conventionally luscious James Marsden. In contrast with his current GQ spiffiness, there was something gawky about the long-chinned actor during this period. But his subversive glint saw him in good stead during the string of riveting misfits he played in the 00s: a self-hating Jewish neo-Nazi in 2001’s The Believer, a crack-addicted high-school teacher in 2006’s Half Nelson, and a somehow-endearing sex-doll enthusiast in 2007’s Lars and the Real Girl.His long showbiz gestation – and being arguably the most memed actor of the social media age – means Gosling feels closer to being one of our own than the typical Hollywood star; a closeness exploited by The Fall Guy in making him the audience proxy, next to airhead megastar Tom Ryder, played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson. Growing up aware of how the industry propagates gender standards, he’s earned his stripes in terms of later making these norms malleable. The damaged complexity of his indie phase persisted in Gosling’s take on masculinity once he was at Hollywood’s high table: the diminished, decentralised and incompetent men of The Nice Guys, Blade Runner 2049, and Barbie.But occasionally he has almost seemed to enjoy succumbing to mainstream industry “nihilism”, as Seavers skewers the oeuvre of Tom Ryder. Gosling’s monosyllabic getaway man in Nicolas Winding Refn’s head-stomping fairytale Drive was, in the actor’s words: “a guy that’s seen too many movies”. He returned to the same caricatural taciturn action mode – sporting a toothpick once again – in the recent Netflix movie The Gray Man.It seems trite to point out the quality now obvious to everyone, but embracing comedy is what really put Gosling in the mainstream. Playing a Neil Strauss-type pickup artist with an unfeasible abdomen in 2011’s Crazy, Stupid, Love was his first wholehearted stab at the genre, though his facility with larkiness was there in his uxorious wiseguy in Blue Valentine the year before. According to the leaked Sony emails, he was still actively canvassing in that direction in a 2014 meeting with studio head Amy Pascal. Crazy, Stupid, Love also cemented him in the zeitgeist as the arch-smoothie of the Hey Girl meme doing the rounds during that period; something he seemed happy to endorse (ironically).The high camp of his recent Oscars performance – the Gentlemen Prefer Blondes aesthetics, tittering as he chin-bumped Mark Ronson – was the fuchsia icing on the cake of his insouciant approach to fame. “I have a theory about leading men,” says Pearce. “They really transcend and become an all-timer the moment they realise that the goofier they are – the more they throw away what other people hold on to, the ‘trying to be cool’ part – then they become something more cool. What Ryan has is a lack of insecurity about teasing himself – about his stardom, his masculinity.”. Paul Newman, and his “ironic sensibility” in the likes of 1966 detective pic Harper, is the classic-era equivalent Pearce had in mind while writing The Fall Guy. But Gosling is even more stylised in his comedy outings: he is a straight man by trade, and often even a stooge. In Barbie, the joke – even in his equine-based embrace of the patriarchy – is always on Ken. Gosling’s old-lady-swindling PI in 2016’s The Nice Guys spends as much time dropping cigarettes down his pants, injuring himself when breaking and entering and irresponsibly parenting as turning up viable leads. A certain underlying tetchiness, allied with his dusty voice, make the actor a natural for this deadpan work. He kills his scenes as credit default swap king Jared Vennett in The Big Short, reeling off predatory financial advice with an unrepentant straight face. His timing and tone are invariably superb. Only Gosling, in an SNL skit, could make a crusade against a bad font play like All the President’s Men.It’s curious to see something as old-school as a straight man become white-hot box office in 2024. And it’s undoubtedly a boon for cinema in its current turbulent and panicked state; it can still spawn blockbusters with enough heat to ignite new stars. It’s not clear if the likes of Timothée Chalamet, Zendaya and Sydney Sweeney are capable of that feat of old: launching a film on their names alone. But Robbie and the veteran Gosling feel closer to possessing that kind of firepower – probably not enough to “save” cinema, but at least to give us hope that it is not in terminal decline.Gosling’s drawn-out, teasing shimmy to the top and tight rapport with audiences gives him added credibility as a headliner. His appeal is sophisticated: his style connects him back to retro masculine archetypes, but with a modern veneer. That throwback musical La La Land – with him holding out for jazz (“It’s dying – but not on my watch”) and old-timey romance – located the sweet spot between the two. Of course, he later sent it up on SNL.But how far can that perfectly calibrated irony take him? If the shtick congeals, he might be a new Roger Moore in waiting. And is his enlightened brand of masculinity, hinting at a course correction for Hollywood gender relations, really meaningful – or just new packaging? But among the many abilities he has shown, Gosling knows how to evolve. To deepen his appeal and artistry, not to mention ticking awards-season boxes, he may have to seek out penetrating roles in straight drama – something, outside reteaming with La La Land director Damien Chazelle in Neil Armstrong biopic First Man, he’s hardly been seen in over the last decade. But for now, the Ryanaissance can wait; he’s the Gosling that’s laying the golden eggs. The Fall Guy is out on 2 May. "

Not long after he embarked on an on/off dalliance with a former colleague, Tom began feeling uneasy about her behaviour. He ended things – but that only made matters worse.Lies and gaslighting turned into his ex turning up randomly at places where he hung out and “appearing seemingly everywhere I went”, he said. “That was incredibly hard to deal with. I felt hounded, and I had no idea what to do.”. Anxious to placate her, he agreed to rekindle their relationship, with boundaries. “That was a terrible mistake,” said Tom (not his real name).One day, she tracked him down while he was travelling in London and chased him through the underground, sexually assaulting him on a carriage. “It was the first time in my life I had to sprint away from someone out of fear,” he said.She followed him to his flat and tried to force her way in. Desperate, he told her he never wanted to see her again and hoped that would be the end of it.It wasn’t. What followed was a frightening period in which, for months, the woman would turn up at places where she knew he would be, or befriend his friends, telling them he was a sexual predator.“I thought it would eventually stop but it never stopped, it only got worse. I felt like I was metaphorically chased into a corner, no aspect of my life was beyond her reach.”. He became depressed and tearful, and said he felt “an immense amount of shame” that he had not been able to “man up” and shrug off her behaviour. Every time he was told to just ignore her, “it sunk me deeper into despair”.Tom’s story echoes parts of the Netflix drama Baby Reindeer, which loosely fictionalises the experience of the comedian Richard Gadd in being stalked by a woman who befriends him in a bar, before her behaviour becomes increasingly obsessive and frightening.The series has been a major hit for the streaming service, but for Tom, watching it was “really terrifying”. And yet finally seeing an experience that mirrored his own had proved “quite healing”, he said.Stalking is a crime that disproportionately affects women, and they are also more likely to be victims of violence. But male stalking victims are more common than might be expected.According to the Crime Survey of England and Wales, one in five women over the age of 16 said last year they had been victims of stalking, and one in 11 (8.7%) of men. That may be an underestimate, particularly among men, according to experts, due to the same stigma identified by Tom. About 13% of those calling the National Stalking Helpline identify as male, according to the Suzy Lamplugh Trust.Conviction rates remain pitifully low, however. New research by the trust found that just 1.7% of reported cases resulted in a conviction. It is calling for specialist training and closer cooperation between police, prosecutors and health and social services to improve this rate.The government this week promised new measures to make it easier to apply for legal restrictions on stalkers’ behaviour. Labour, meanwhile has pledged to introduce a national stalking action plan and overhaul the police response.It was only after Tom became completely desperate that he called the helpline, and then eventually went to the police. While most officers were sympathetic, he felt let down by the investigation, which he said was never conducted with much energy. His stalker was arrested at one point, but has never been convicted.He said he felt his gender played a part: “How serious can it be? It’s just a man being stalked by a woman.”. Helen Newlove, the victims’ commissioner for England and Wales, told the Guardian stalking was “a pervasive, deeply unsettling and dangerous crime – and it can escalate dramatically”.She said the crime remained poorly understood by some agencies, and was not treated with the seriousness it deserved. “Whether male or female, we must ensure that all victims are able to access the protection, support and justice that they need.”. In the UK, the National Stalking Helpline can be reached on 0808 802 0300."

The former Village Voice and New York Observer photographer James Hamilton lives in a small Manhattan apartment on University Place that also doubles as his studio. There’s a dark room in the corner, where Hamilton develops his images, using chemical ingredients plucked from a wine cooler. His walls are lined with books and stacks of photos, a treasure trove of portraits and reportage he’s shot over the decades, among them BB King in concert, Liza Minelli at home and Muhammad Ali out in the streets.“This is James Stewart in Rear Window,” says director Wes Anderson, when recalling his first impression of Hamilton, and his apartment, in Uncropped, the documentary he executive-produces. Hamilton wouldn’t argue against the comparison. Rear Window – Hitchcock’s classic about an adventurous newspaper photographer taken off the job by a broken leg, abandoned to spy on his neighbours – is a formative film for the cinephile cameraman.“I was not inspired to be a photographer by that film, but I was inspired to live his life,” Hamilton tells the Guardian, very matter-of-factly, on a Zoom call. “I live in the same neighborhood that [Jimmy Stewart’s character] lived in Rear Window. Almost the same block. He mentions the Albert hotel, which is directly across from where I live.”. I’m speaking to Hamilton and Uncropped’s director, DW Young, about the film, which is not only a portrait of the man behind some of the most iconic portraits, but also a look back at a lost era in alternative news media, the staff photographer for the Voice in the 70s and 80s, with stints at the Rolling Stone predecessor Crawdaddy, Harper’s Bazaar and the New York Observer flanking that period.He’s photographed Hollywood galas, capturing images of Jane Mansfield leading a conga line and Cary Grant describing his knife phobia to guests, and has captured Jack Nicholson, Martin Scorsese, Hitchcock and pretty much every rock band that passed through Greenwich Village in some of their most funky or recognisable poses. He describes his photography as “arranging chaos”, whether we’re looking at street scenes with kids playing or feminists protesting, or celebrities bringing that same disruptive energy to hotel room photo shoots.As a photographer for an alt-weekly like the Voice, he was also poking his camera within spaces and movements that few other outlets at the time would cover with such rigor. During our interview, Young whips out a photo book featuring Hamilton’s images of the burgeoning hip-hop scene, like an image of guys hanging on a low-rise stoop with their boombox in Brooklyn’s Gravesend, and portraits taken in Hamilton’s own apartment of LL Cool J, Run DMC and the pioneering group Funky 4 + 1. “The Voice was very important for covering hip-hop early,” says the director, pointing to rigorous writing from music critics like Robert Christgau, Gary Giddens and Greg Tate who, in keeping with the Voice’s whole vibe, embraced the scrappy new sound coming from the Bronx. “When I look through the old issues and start seeing the articles, it really brings it home. [They were] giving hip-hop legitimacy, treating it seriously, seeing all it had to offer as an art form and getting heavy critics involved.”. Hamilton is sitting beside Young at the latter’s Brooklyn Heights apartment. He would have logged in from his own landmark pad had he been comfortable with Zoom. He’s a very analog guy, though he has been dabbling with Facebook lately, digitizing so much of his stunning street photography as a way to archive the work and share with his intimate circles. “Putting pictures on Facebook motivated me,” says Hamilton, about his foray online. “It gave me a job. It amused me. It amused my friends.”. Those Facebook posts caught the attention of Young’s life and producing partner, Judith Mizrachy (Hamilton’s former New York Observer colleague) and became the impetus for Uncropped, a time capsule hardwired with a sense of melancholy with every page flip through the archive. Ironic that social media led to the rediscovery of Hamilton’s photography while it’s that very technology that makes that work impossible today.Gone are the lively everyday street scenes because, as Hamilton explains, now everyone in New York is looking at their phones. Also gone are the more candid, spontaneous and authentically vulnerable photographs with actors and rock stars. “Everyone goes around with extra makeup, dressed a special way, so that they can be photographed in a completely glamorized form for Instagram,” says Young, describing today’s heavily filtered, PR’d and posed aesthetics, a stark contrast from the harsh and dramatic lighting and action Hamilton worked with. “They expect to be photographed at any moment during the day, in a selfie or whatever. They’re only comfortable with that kind of photograph. A street photograph would expose the falsity of that.”. Young also describes the collective cultural hum below 23rd Street that is no longer there. The Village Voice, with its 22 Greenwich Avenue office just a quick stroll from Hamilton’s apartment, was at the centre of so much artistic and even anarchistic movement, which meant its writers and photographers were already in the centre of so much action. “There was the ability to interact with many, many scenes in proximity to one another,” says Young, describing the time when the Voice was still in print, before the internet democratized but also saturated media and its value, and bohemians could still afford to live in Manhattan. “That creative combined energy was really critical. That has fractured because of prices of real estate and all the other things. A lot of that world is harder to find on the street.”. Hamilton’s work with alt-weeklies, from the Voice to the New York Observer, continued into the internet era; even after Jared Kushner bought the latter, turning it into a tabloid focused on business and real estate interests, gentrifying the brand so that it lost its character like a New York neighbourhood overrun by glass towers. “Another building’s blocking the view of the Empire State,” says Hamilton, describing the shifts.But in the end, it wasn’t these shifting winds, in media and New York culture, that took Hamilton out of commission. He was struck by a car, which broke his leg, just like the guy in Rear Window.Uncropped is out now in NY and LA cinemas and digitally on 7 May with a UK release to be announced. "

When push comes to shove the defending champions tend to raise their game and a resolute defensive display was rewarded when Owen Farrell kicked the winning penalty goal three minutes from time to edge a heavy-duty contest.So much for the increasing trend towards wide open, free-flowing Premiership try-fests. This was a frequently rugged, old school game, ultimately shaped by defensive commitment, and when the dust finally settled it was Sarries who emerged best placed to secure a potential home semi-final when the playoffs commence next month.They had to work mighty hard for it, keeping Bath scoreless in the opening 40 minutes and building victory on the foundations of first-half tries from Tom Parton and Rotimi Segun. Just when it seemed as though close-quarters tries from Thomas du Toit and Cameron Redpath might have revitalised Bath, however, Farrell’s decisive penalty from bang in front of the posts ultimately silenced the home crowd.It was not always pretty, with Saracens repeatedly opting to kick the ball high to deny their hosts the oxygen of easy attacking ball, but the ends fully justified the means. While there are certain to be plenty more twists and turns between now and the end of the regular season, this outcome may well have a major impact on the final top four shakedown.“It feels big,” admitted Mark McCall, Saracens’ director of rugby. “We needed to rediscover some of the team energy and spirit that has been a bit lacking in the last couple of weeks. We needed to have each other’s backs and fight for each other throughout the game and I’m really proud that we did that. That can be a springboard for us.”. Whether a fit Finn Russell would have altered the equation no one will never know but Bath certainly missed their creative kingpin. They will also wonder what might have happened had Maro Itoje seen red instead of yellow for an upright high tackle on Alfie Barbeary, prompting howls of protest from the home faithful.Some of the replays did not look great but the referee, Luke Pearce, eventually decided the first contact had been slightly lower and was only worthy a yellow card, a decision which puzzled Bath’s director of rugby, Johann van Graan. “What I saw was a head-on-head collision,” he said, otherwise keen to salute Saracens’ grit and determination. “That was as close to a Test match in the Premiership as you can get. That’s why they are the champions. It was a titanic battle.”. The watching England head coach, Steve Borthwick, had no shortage of international squad members to monitor on a cool, still evening, with Barbeary and Charlie Ewels both excellent for Bath and Theo Dan making another eye-catching contribution off the bench for Sarries. Farrell was also a pivotal figure, sparking a wonderful late 80-metre break-out which forced the position from which Bath eventually conceded a ruck penalty and allowed him to slot the winning points.Sign up to The Breakdown. The latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewed. after newsletter promotion. It was a whole lot tighter than had seemed likely just prior to half-time when, in Itoje’s temporary absence, the 14-man Saracens came up with arguably the game’s crucial moment. The ball bounced loose in their half and Segun burst on to it, leaving a clutch of Bath defenders trailing in his wake. Farrell’s subsequent deft kick-pass then found Segun again and the wing ensured his side went in 12-0 ahead at the interval.It was a far cry from the last time Saracens played beside the River Avon at the end of last season when they conceded 61 points, albeit with a weakened matchday squad. They are a less consistent side than they were in their trophy-laden heyday but a touch of their old familiar cussedness was increasingly evident.Bath knew they had to respond and duly did so when their replacement front-row drove Saracens up and backwards at a keynote scrum. Now it was the visitors who were under siege and close-range maul tries inside eight minutes from Du Toit and Redpath seemed to have stolen the initiative. They reckoned without Sarries standing firm when it mattered most and giving Farrell one last chance to propel his side up to second place in the table."

He is said to have been dissatisfied with his role in the team and to have been disquieted by the furore that has engulfed them since the team principal, Christian Horner, was accused of inappropriate behaviour by a female employee.The grievances against Horner, who has always denied any wrongdoing, were dismissed by an independent inquiry but the complainant has appealed. The case is considered to be part of a wider battle for control at Red Bull, in which the leaks relating to Newey may also play a part as a further attempt to destabilise Horner.If Newey were to leave it would be a serious blow for Red Bull, for whom his cars have helped secure seven drivers’ titles and six constructors’ championships. It would potentially cause the world champion, Max Verstappen, to further consider his future with them, which is already under question.Ferrari, Aston Martin and Mercedes would all be strong contenders for Newey should he leave but as Red Bull have stated he is contracted with them until 2025. If there were gardening leave clauses in that contract, as is the norm, he could be prevented from starting with another team until 2027 and unable to influence the design of a car from scratch until the 2028 model, two years after the new regulations come into play.Meanwhile in the buildup to next week’s Miami GP, the British driver Oliver Bearman’s chances of entering F1 next season were enhanced when the Sauber team announced they have signed Nico Hülkenberg from Haas, freeing up a seat. Bearman is a Ferrari junior and the reserve driver at Haas, who have a technical relationship with the Scuderia and who would be looking to place him with the team for experience.Bearman was stood in for Carlos Sainz at the Saudi Arabian GP this year.

Even when the 22-year-old has lost, he has usually offered a full demonstration of his talent.Draper’s time at the Madrid Open this year, however, ended with unusual haste on Friday as his poor serving was punished by a spectacular Hubert Hurkacz, the eighth seed, who rolled through to reach the third round with a 6-1, 7-5 win.“I didn’t serve as well, that was the main thing, really,” said Draper. “If I played him 10 times and served at 43% [first serves in], you’re probably going to lose every time. I think also you’ve got to acknowledge that he played extremely well today.”. Draper entered Madrid at an interesting point in his young career. While he has struggled badly with injuries over the past two years on the tour, he has performed well whenever healthy and maintained a decent ranking.But now that he has finally been able to play a full schedule and remain healthy in recent months, he is learning how much of a challenge it is to consistently perform at the highest level. Currently ranked No 43, he has compiled a 7-7 record since ­February. Before this tournament, Draper pointed out all of his defeats had been in three sets, a reflection of how fine the margins have been for him.This time, Draper was caught cold by an excellent Hurkacz, who burst out of the gates firing down service winners and playing ultra-aggressive tennis off both wings. Draper, meanwhile, served terribly. By 0-5, he had landed just 33% of first serves and he struggled badly to hit through the court, his spin-heavy forehand rising up into the hitting zone of Hurkacz.Draper handled himself far better in the second set, increasing his intensity and finding his own huge lefty first serve. But Hurkacz possesses the best serve in the world, a devastating, precise delivery, and the pressure to keep on hold of your own serve is immense. It took just one nervous service game from Draper at 5-5 in set two for Hurkacz to take the decisive break and seal the victory.Just 30 minutes after this loss, he maintained an impressive perspective even in his disappointment. He noted that he was never really an ATP Tour player over the past few years, given all of his injuries, and he considers this year his first full season.“This year is the first time I’m playing top-10 players, top-20 players week in, week out. Also not being seeded at these tournaments, you have a decent first-round win and then you have to play a Hurkacz or a [Taylor] Fritz, or someone who is a top, top player.“I think all these matches are good for me, just learning more. I’m definitely gaining more experience as a player. Even a match like today, I can draw more from it.”. Sign up to The Recap.

One of the first lessons that Draper has come to understand in recent months is that, when you are healthy, every tournament week presents a new opportunity. He will return home to London and rest for a few days, but the Italian Open in Rome will soon begin, another chance to find his feet against the best players in the world.“I’m very privileged to be in the position I am, I’m in a great head-space,” he said. “Not injured, which is the main thing – being able to play. I’ve been on the other side of it where it’s like I can’t play Wimbledon, can’t do this, can’t do that. I’d much rather have the opportunity to come here each week, see what it’s all about and work hard to win these matches.”. Katie Boulter suffered a brutal 1-6, 6-3, 6-4 defeat by Robin Montgomery, a wildcard, in her first ever WTA main draw match on clay. Aryna Sabalenka and Carlos Alcaraz, both defending champions and second seeds, began their title defences with victories. Sabalenka narrowly edged past Magda Linette 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 to set up a third-round meeting with Montgomery, while Alcaraz effortlessly defeated Alexander Shevchenko 6-2, 6-1 to reach the third round in Madrid."

I probably don’t do it as often as I did, but when I do, I make up for it. I enjoy having a few shots and going on the vodka, but I never do it too close to a tournament now, and that’s the difference.”. Allen, who reached the semi-finals last year – only his second appearance in the one-table set-up after a series of early-round disappointments – revealed he was convinced to change his mindset after a painful 13-4 second-round defeat to Ronnie O’Sullivan in 2022.That loss coincided with a period of turmoil in his private life, after divorcing his then wife in 2020, and declaring himself bankrupt the following year despite career earnings in excess of £3.5m.Allen added: “Ronnie wasn’t playing anywhere near his best and he still brushed me aside, and I had to ask myself whether I wanted to be that player who came back here and didn’t challenge.“It’s been deflating coming here so many times and underperforming, because I know I’ve got the game to win it. I’ve tried so many things and so far none of them have worked, but I feel like I’ve improved things in recent years and I’ve come into the tournament this year on a whole new level.”. Judd Trump is two frames away from a return to the quarter-finals after pulling away from Tom Ford to establish an 11-5 overnight lead. Leading 7-2 after Thursday’s opening session, the third seed took the first frame on Friday before Ford spurned a strong chance of this year’s first Crucible maximum, running aground on 73 after 10 reds and nine blacks.Trump capitalised on a series of errors from Ford to ease further clear and at one stage looked capable of winning the match with a session to spare, before the 14th seed rallied and took the final frame of the day with a break of 83.Sign up to The Recap.

David Gilbert dispatched Robert Milkins 13-4 to become the first player through to the quarter-finals, and revealed a rigorous fitness regime is behind his push to reach the last four for the first time since 2019.Leading 12-4 after Friday’s morning session, Gilbert required just 17 minutes to complete his victory over the 16th seed, who was hampered by a recurring back injury and showed the extent of his frustration by hurling his cue after missing a simple red in the 12th frame.“The lesson I learned from when I got to the semi-final was you have to be as fit as possible,” said Gilbert. “I’m using my time wisely, eating properly and the right things. I’m hitting the gym, pure weights and just trying to lift as heavy as I can. I’m going to smash the gym and keep eating the right stuff.”. Stephen Maguire battled to a 5-3 overnight lead against the 2005 winner, Shaun Murphy, while Jak Jones carved a 9-7 advantage over Si Jiahui, a surprise semi-finalist last year, after a poor quality second session of their second-round match. Jones, the lowest ranked player left in the tournament at No 44, is looking to reach the quarter-finals for the second year in a row."

Using a draft slot normally targeted for players expected to make an immediate impact, the Falcons picked Penix as the apparent long-term successor to the 35-year-old Cousins. The Falcons had been expected to use the pick to boost their pass rush.The Falcons also focused on offensive playmakers with their last three first-round picks. Tight end Kyle Pitts was the No 4 overall pick in 2021, followed by wide receiver Drake London and running back Bijan Robinson, each No 8, the last two years.Penix, who will be 24 as a rookie, led FBS schools with 4,903 passing yards and was third with 36 touchdown passes at Washington in 2023. He won the Maxwell Award as the nation’s top player.Mike McCarthy, Cousins’ agent, said the quarterback was ‘surprised’ by the selection. “Yes, it was a big surprise,” McCarthy told NFL Network. “We had no idea this was coming. The truth is the whole league had no idea this was coming. We got no heads up. Kirk got a call from the Falcons when they were on the clock. That was the first we heard. It never came up in any conversation.”. Penix is widely considered to be the most pro-ready of any of this year’s quarterback prospects. If the Falcons were to pick a quarterback, it was expected they would pick either JJ McCarthy or Drake Maye, developmental prospects who would sit behind Cousins for a couple of seasons.With Cousins tied to a contract that will run for at least two years, Atlanta faces the prospect of sitting Penix until he is 26 years old.Falcons general manager Terry Fontenot said this week he would consider selecting a quarterback high in the draft even when most of the outside focus had been on edge rushers. “If we see a player that we believe can be a franchise quarterback at any point, whether it’s this draft, next draft, whether it’s a player we can trade for, whatever it is, you have to bring that player in because we’re talking about the next four to five years plus when we’re talking about guys that we’re drafting,” Fontenot said.This does not look like a room delighted with what they just did pic.twitter.com/QGEpKjU6sv. “No different than when we’re talking about any other position, like you said, you can say it’s surplus now, but it can be a major need down the road. I think because of that and because of the magnitude of the effects and the impact of that position, then you always have to be willing to bring players in.”. The Falcons’ draft won’t by affected by the NFL’s investigation of the team’s possible violation of tampering policies before signing Cousins, who appeared to indicate he had been in communication with team officials at a time the team would have been permitted to talk only with his agent."

A campaign that began with Enzo Maresca insisting his Leicester players sleep overnight at their sprawling, 185-acre Seagrave training base for the first week of pre-­season in the name of team building has ended with their primary mission accomplished: promotion boxed off, the Championship crown likely to follow.Leicester’s most memorable and marvellous moment came when they confounded expectations; this time, it was a case of simply meeting them by getting back to the Premier League at the first attempt.Perhaps it should come as no surprise that surely the most expensively assembled squad in the division – their wage bill was the biggest outside the Premier League top six 12 months ago – has sealed that return after Leeds lost at QPR on Friday night, but it turned into a slog after they ceded a 17-point lead. In the past couple of months, their campaign has flitted between a sense of collapse and catharsis. “It has been a very long season,” Maresca said with a wry smile this week.Those days last July allowed Maresca – a disciple of Pep Guardiola in terms of style of play and seemingly tailoring (few can pull off a cream pullover) – to hammer home his possession-hungry mantra, one that has split opinion among supporters despite Leicester being on course to record a century of points, a tally only Burnley, last season, have managed since Leicester won promotion under Nigel Pearson a decade ago.Then, few would have envisaged the extraordinary run that followed – the 5,000-1 title, Champions League trips, a first FA Cup – but, rather than dreaming of a repeat of those heady days, pragmatism will surely strangle their return to the top division.Beyond the golden relief, the scent of champagne, the confetti and the wild celebrations – Maresca jived with Abdul Fatawu in the dressing room after the forward’s hat-trick in the midweek rout of Southampton rendered promotion all but a formality – there is an unsettling hue of grey.Now, finally, we know which division Leicester will play in next season but look past that and there is a jarring current of unknowns. Most of which stem from Leicester’s ultimate failure to keep up with the Premier League’s elite in the years since Claudio Ranieri did the unthinkable.Will the Premier League release the transfer embargo the English Football League imposed on the club for breaching profitability and sustainability rules (PSR) in March? If not, what happens to Jamie Vardy, Wilfred Ndidi and Jannik Vestergaard, among the regulars out of contract at the end of June? Will Leicester be powerless to rubber-stamp the £14.5m deal they agreed with Sporting to sign Fatawu in the event of promotion? “In this moment, it is complicated,” Maresca said on Tuesday.Under the embargo, Leicester cannot re-sign players or register new ones without EFL approval. Leicester will formally become a Premier League club again at the annual general meeting in Harrogate at the end of June. The league may well have a few questions for them.Then there is the small matter of a potential double whammy of points deductions. Will they materialise and, if so, when? Leicester issued legal action after being charged by the Premier League for allegedly breaking PSR rules for the period ending 2022‑23. It seems unlikely Leicester will start next season on minus points, with their case likely to prove protracted because it falls outside the framework introduced last year to accelerate decisions.Sign up to Football Daily. Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football. after newsletter promotion. The club are expected to exceed the permitted financial losses for the three-year cycle ending 2023-24, unless they are able to generate significant funds before the accounting period ends on 30 June. It seems inevitable that Leicester will consider, if not seek, offers for Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, comfortably their most valuable asset. They have not denied being at risk of breaching the EFL’s threshold limit for 2023-24 and when releasing their most recent accounts announcing a £90m loss this month, conceded they “may be found not in compliance with the applicable P&S rules for the three-year reporting period ending 2022-23”.The driver of Leicester’s financial headaches is heavy spending but this season they have not got a lot wrong in terms of recruitment. Mads Hermansen, a goalkeeper as comfortable with the ball at his feet as in his gloves, was arguably the most important piece of the puzzle. Fatawu, who was flagged to Maresca by the head of recruitment, Martyn Glover, and Stephy Mavididi have been revelations on the wings and Harry Winks has been tidy and consistent in midfield.The defenders Conor Coady and Callum Doyle, the latter signed on loan from Manchester City, have not played as much as expected owing to the form of Vestergaard, whose transformation is arguably the story of Leicester’s season given he spent much of the last one training in isolation. That Vestergaard, a 6ft 6in centre-back, has had 4,290 touches this season – more than any other player in the division – illustrates how central he has been to their success and his role in fuelling back-to-front attacks. Leicester have scored a league-high 86 goals, with Dewsbury-Hall contributing 14 assists.Given their wobble – and it was a sizeable one given they lost six of their 10 matches before beating West Brom last Sarurday – Leicester deserve credit for getting over the line. Vardy, naturally, has played his part. The 37-year-old has averaged at least one goal every other game in all competitions this season and he initiated the players’ meeting that prompted the much-needed turnaround after a shock defeat at struggling Plymouth.“There was a lot of honesty,” said Marc Albrighton, one of those whose contract is expiring. “We felt sometimes over the course of especially the second half of the season, the lads seemed to not want to take certain risks.”. Leicester may pay the price for one or two on their return to the top table."

Wrexham’s last game in League Two is against the new champions, Stockport County, and Mullin is determined to end another tumultuous and successful season with a personal milestone.If Mullin scores against Stockport he will become the first player since Alan Shearer to have racked up at least 25 goals in four consecutive seasons across the top five flights of English football. Mullin has spent the past hour thoughtfully discussing his role in the delirium surrounding Wrexham’s rise under the celebrity ownership of Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney and a range of subjects from finding acceptance and even joy in his son’s autism to how this season began with a fleeting acknowledgment of his seemingly imminent death.The 29-year-old speaks with fresh intensity: “I’m a winner. Every single day in training I want to be on the winning team. So, come Saturday, I’m going out to win the game and then I’ll enjoy some time off. If you win, everything always feels better.”. The third season of Welcome to Wrexham, the wildly popular documentary series which tracks Reynolds’ and McElhenney’s involvement with one of the world’s oldest football clubs, begins next week. There is sure to be more of the same recipe as Hollywood and a gritty old Welsh city continue their sporting romcom – and Mullin smiles when I ask if Reynolds and McElhenney will be in Wrexham on Saturday.“I think Rob’s intending to be there. But they’re always there in spirit, and online, at every game. As soon as we leave the pitch, Ryan’s the first to text me, even before my missus.”. When they took over in the summer of 2021 it was made plain to Reynolds and McElhenney that to find a way out of non-league football they needed a superior striker. It became McElhenney’s task to woo Mullin away from Cambridge United – whose promotion to League One had been built on his record 32 goals in the preceding campaign.In his enjoyable book, My Wrexham Story, Mullin stresses that the names of the two American actors meant nothing to him when the club approached him. It’s amusing that Reynolds now describes Mullin’s autobiography as “the best book I’ve ever read” and McElhenney calls his star player “one of the greatest footballers in the world”. Their wryly gushing praise is rooted in an appreciation of the 90 league goals he has scored in three seasons for Wrexham.Does Mullin still feel the weight of responsibility foisted on him when he moved down two divisions to the National League? “It’s exactly the same,” Mullin replies. “But the thing I’m most proud of is that when the pressure’s really on, I tend to play my best football. Having the expectation and the weight on me to deliver is something I relish – because that pressure comes when you’re successful.”. The latest batch of internet stories about Mullin have stated that he will make history and surpass the likes of Thierry Henry and Harry Kane if he achieves his fourth straight 25-goal haul this season. Yet it seems to have been forgotten that Shearer achieved this feat playing for Blackburn Rovers and Newcastle United between 1993 and 1997. Is Mullin aware of the hype? “Yeah, somebody told me the other day. It’s something I’d love to achieve. Personal accolades are brilliant but the real goal was to get promoted, and we’ve achieved that. Anything else is just a bonus.”. The season began worryingly for Mullin. During a pre-season friendly against Manchester United in San Diego, a collision with the opposition goalkeeper, Nathan Bishop, meant that Mullin sustained a collapsed lung and four broken ribs. “The lung got punctured but at first I thought I’m just winded,” Mullin says. “So I lay there, waiting for it to pass. But for almost two minutes I couldn’t take a breath in. It was horrendous. [His teammates] Elliot Lee and Anthony Forde stood over me and the looks on their faces made me even worse. Afterwards they told me my lips turned blue.“It was only for a few split seconds but I just accepted the fact that I can’t breathe. So I stopped trying because it was causing me pain. But giving up allowed me to breathe and the medical professionals were soon around me, giving me oxygen.”. That momentary brush with his own mortality lingered in hospital. “That night they told me I couldn’t fly home for a couple of weeks. I just wanted to see my little boy, Albi, and my partner, Mollie, and I’m actually getting emotional now thinking about it. I started crying in hospital because it was hard to accept. But of course Albi was fine and that’s all that matters.”. The most moving chapter in Mullin’s book, which was written last year, is devoted to Albi and his autism. Mullin often struggled with guilt when away from his son and with anxiety over Albi’s future. But the difference today is marked. “Writing it was really tough but reading the audiobook was even harder, because then the emotion comes out and you hear it in my voice,” Mullin says. “Now, thankfully, I found a way to not feel it so much. I wouldn’t change Albi for a second but I’d researched so many things and I had the chance to go to America to see specialists to try to help him become talkative. But I sat down with Mollie and said: ‘I don’t want to do it. I don’t want anything that changes his personality.’”. How did Mullin change his own attitude? “We went on a family holiday and decided we weren’t going to do all the intensive stuff we did every day to try to help him. For two weeks, we just relaxed with Albi. Me and Millie saw the biggest improvement in Albi because he was happy. I understood that nothing else mattered.“It’s not that we’ve stopped trying to help him – but if he doesn’t want to do it we’re not going to force him. I’ll keep trying different things until he wants to enjoy one. He’s now so cute and happy and if he isn’t smiling he’s probably asleep. He’s talking more and copying us more. Yesterday we had his presents delivered and I’m looking forward to enjoying his fifth birthday with him.”. Mullin is passionate in his support of the Your Space autism charity in Wrexham. He has also worn the Autism Awareness logo on his football boots and he always makes an A for Albi, and autism, after scoring.Sign up to Football Daily. Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football. after newsletter promotion. But in October 2022 he posted a different logo on his boots: Fuck the Tories. Outrage followed and the club asked him not to wear the boots. “I thought it was brilliant,” he says with a grin. “I didn’t even have to wear them and all the channels, like the BBC, showed the world what the Tories were. Who cares what’s on the side of football boots? The bit that bothered me most is that three words on the side of a football boot offended some people a lot more than starving children do.“The boots were a lot more meaningful to me when I stuck an autism logo on the side in the FA Cup against Sheffield United. That’s the real cause – acceptance of autism – and something I’ll continue to do because it’s crucial to so many people who need help. Obviously the Tory boots will be surplus to requirements pretty soon. Then hopefully we can make headway giving real help to kids, and to the country as a whole.”. Mullin has a platform because he is recognised constantly in Wrexham and Liverpool, where he still lives, and in America where the documentary has been so popular. “It’s a privilege people stop me for a photo but I still get awkward and embarrassed – because I’m just me. But it was really touching when they did the mural of me in Wrexham. I’m used to seeing them round Anfield so to have my own in Wrexham makes me really grateful.”. How will he feel if a bigger club tries to sign him? “Obviously, I want to play at the highest level possible. I’d love to play for Wales, the country where my nan was born. But in terms of leaving the club it’s never something I think about. I signed a new contract with Wrexham in January because I absolutely adore it. I come home every day and see Albi, which is the main reason I signed in the first place.‘I’m here for the next two years. The fans love me, I love them and everything about the club. But if another club made an offer and Wrexham accepted it, then I’m in a position where they’re telling me to go. It’s not something I’m looking for or would wish to happen. It’s quite the opposite. I’d love to play in the Premier League for Wrexham. That’s the pipe dream.“It’s also the owners’ dream to one day become a Premier League club. Who knows whether that takes 10 or 20 years? Fifty years or five years? Ryan and Rob are really ambitious and phenomenally successful in all they do. In football they don’t want it to be any different. They want to keep going and get us promoted again.”. Is it feasible that Wrexham could reach the Championship at the end of next season? “All I know is we’re going to give it everything to be at the top end of the table and we have a winner’s mentality. It’s going to be tougher but it’s a challenge we’ll relish.”. Mullin was bullied as a young boy by a coach at the Everton academy and released years later from the Liverpool academy by Steve Cooper, who lost his position as Nottingham Forest’s manager this season. Micky Mellon, the manager at Tranmere, also never gave Mullin much chance to establish himself. They all now know about Mullin’s success at Wrexham but he says: “I don’t know if I feel vindicated. I always believed I would do well and somebody else’s opinion was never going to alter my belief whether I was at Morecambe, Swindon or Tranmere. It’s more pleasing for my family but I just look ahead.”. The Wrexham squad will soon fly to Las Vegas as, like last year, Reynolds and McElhenney are helping them celebrate promotion in style. But Mullin is looking much farther ahead and he believes he could “absolutely” play at a higher level for another six years.“I’m coming into my prime,” Mullin says at the end of this long but triumphant season. “I feel physically better than ever and I’m absolutely loving it. I want to continue as long as possible and could probably do a bit more recovery work when I get home. That’s not so easy having a child like Albi – but I wouldn’t change a thing. His happiness will always be my No 1 priority.”. Paul Mullin’s autobiography, My Wrexham Story, is published by Century. "

And so we entered the age of the noble, blameless bald men. This is a pretty good moment to be Ineos at Manchester United. Nothing really matters yet. Every problem is someone else’s problem. Every solution is your own.For now you’re just hope, blue sky. You’re a silent reproach on a gantry. You’re a tieless Tony Blair jamming with Shed Seven in the Downing Street garden. And even the bad things are kind of good, because you’re not the bad things.This phase will also soon be over. Decisions about hard football things will need to be made. Most obviously, it is very hard right now to see Erik ten Hag keeping his job at the end of the season.Champions League qualification has already been set as a retention target. More broadly this is a question of ideology. Lever-pullers need to pull levers. Gain-seekers need to find their gains. And there is no more obvious margin than the man standing on the touchline. It would almost be a betrayal of method not to get the cleaver out.At which point it is worth noting that, as of this weekend, Gareth Southgate remains favourite to become the next Manchester United manager. What to make of this, really?. Plenty of things still have to happen before it becomes a possibility. There has to be a vacancy (likely). Southgate has to be available (his England contract ends this year). Both parties have to want this to happen (United are said to be keen). Most importantly the public response needs to fall somewhere below the threshold of masked middle-aged men in tracksuits staging an Ian-Brown-walk invasion of Old Trafford.And that public reaction remains the most interesting part for now. When the prospect was first floated a couple of months ago I also thought it was just a really terrible idea. It almost felt like a hoax, a banter-thread made flesh. Positions have been taken on Southgate. The moment there’s a stumble or the football is dull, those pre-cooked waves of outrage will unleash themselves. @Dz30304 will go mental. Men on YouTube will rant fluently in office swivel chairs. Why even tangle with this?. The thing is, having thought about it, I have now come full circle. Southgate to Manchester United is in fact a brilliant idea. Maybe it’s the last great idea left, an idea so compelling it is impossible even to consider doing anything else .Firstly, for reasons specific to the struggles of the Manchester United industrial-complex. This is a club that has basically stopped over the last 10 years. It’s a haunted house, a ghost ship peopled by zombies, noises through the wall, a place where the past constantly devours the present.Something profound needs to happen to move this on. Manchester United doesn’t need a brilliant tactician. It needs a systems expert, an industrial descaler. Essentially, it needs a shit-flusher. And Southgate is unarguably one of those, is in fact the only person out there with a recent record of doing exactly this, of taking a stalled and sclerotic football institution and turning it into a happier, lighter place.Southgate did this with England. Yes he did. Really. He just did. Take a trip back to the years 2000-2016, scan the stellar squad lists, click on the actual footage, and accept that he did this, even if he also asked people not to mind players taking the knee or didn’t pick Player X so is therefore a supply teacher fraud or something.Southgate fits United’s new owners. He knows the Brailsford-Ashworth nexus. He’s good at making young players feel good. He oversaw the DNA stuff with England, the pathway, the sense of organic continuity United so clearly lacks.Mainly he has the things this institution has clearly missed: backbone, ruthlessness, the inability to tell a lie. Who has actually told the truth inside old Trafford in the last decade? Ralf Rangnick, who was immediately bundled off in a van. Louis van Gaal, out on the heath yelling into the storm. Southgate will tell the truth, and it will hurt, and this is good.Sign up to Football Daily. Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football. after newsletter promotion. You can almost see it already. Southgate in a press conference being stubborn and refusing to promise anything. Southgate coming on like a Lutheran minister, astringent, vinegary, disapproving. Southgate as the greatest thing that ever happened to Antony. Southgate losing heroically in the Europa League final and applauding the fans in shirtsleeves and everyone feeling husky and brave.Because this needs to feel like a purging, like an institutional enema. In fact the public backlash is utterly vital. The YouTubers have to squeal, the bots and plastics and aggregators need to feel the squeeze, with no traction here, nothing to cling to, drowning in their own toxins while Southgate says things like “our best might not be enough”, a Southgate who offers not glory or jam today, but a cure, a cleansing, a rain that will come some day and wash all this filth from the streets.And yes, this does in fact sound deluded and hysterical and probably also not what will happen in practice. Here we have another illusion, another case of the great man theory, the idea that one person can cure a sickly institution. And that this miracle worker is in fact a decent, intelligent man who has no real pedigree in club management, but does seems unusually honest.The fact is I actually want Southgate, or at least my own deluded and desperate vision of Southgate, to have every job. Not just in football. I want him to nationalise the trains. I want him to take over Boots. I want to luxuriate in this, the glow of the imagined Southgate personality. Perhaps this is how dictatorships start, false nostalgia for a nonexistent past protected on to a single stern-faced person in a nicely cut suit. Maybe Southgate is in fact the most dangerous man in Britain.More likely, this has now become an article about the actual story of Manchester United, the reason why it is such a disproportionate obsession, why it seems necessary to dwell endlessly on the exact reasons why one very rich football club finishes sixth and not second, to imbue this with an epic-scale sense of decay.It is of course the Manchester United-as-Britain dynamic. Can you feel it? Here is a football club that seems to embody more than any other a parallel sense of falling away: what has been called the “shitification” of modern life, the stretching thin of previously valuable things, hollowing out of institutions, stuff that basically doesn’t work any more, and to a deliberate design.Can things be fixed? This is the question Manchester United always seems to be asking. If so could this really lie in the hands of Sir Big Sir Jim Sir Ratcliffe and the unlikely figure of Southgate, who is wealthy, 53 years old and may just want to go off and become an artisan beekeeper in any case.Standing tall, a luminous reformer in the wreckage of Camelot. This actually sounds quite tiring. Not to mention destined, in all likelihood, to end up another strangely seductive piece of myth-making."

Trying to catch lightning in a cider bottle would be only slightly harder right now than containing Bristol’s dazzling attacking game. The Bears have been averaging 50 points per match in winning five successive league fixtures and, going into Saturday’s crucial visit to Leicester, are playing with a freedom and momentum few of their playoff-chasing rivals can match.Setting the pace has been their pocket dynamo Harry Randall, who guides his team around the field at such a whirring tempo they are blowing opponents away. Last week they put 85 points on a hapless Newcastle and when Randall last played at Welford Road a couple of months ago he starred in England A’s 91-5 win over Portugal, underlining his credentials as a classy catalyst who could add a further spark to the senior England team.There are just two things that might slow him down over the domestic season’s closing weeks and their names are Lyla and Noa. Randall and his partner, Kelsey, are the proud parents of seven-week-old twin girls and the scrum-half’s trademark energy is currently being tested. “The days of sitting on the sofa and watching sport for the rest of the afternoon have very much disappeared,” he says, wryly. “I still get to watch a bit but you’re occupied by other things like feeding and changing nappies.”. If Bristol do maintain their upward trajectory and win the Gallagher Premiership it could yet be that Kelsey qualifies for a medal of her own, having selflessly allowed Harry to have some extra sleep when he needs it. “We’ve tried to come up with a bit of a plan because I need to get a good block of sleep in before big training days and games. The day before games she allows me to go into the spare room. I’ll do a little feed before bed and then I’ll go in there and tuck up.”. So far it has paid off handsomely. Randall is the “zip zip” man who exploits any gaps left by tiring opposing defenders and his Energizer Bunny routine helps to bring out the best in those around him. Fingertip passing, deft offloads, myriad support runners; Pat Lam’s side kicked the ball away just four times in the whole Newcastle game.It is the thrilling product of a collective midwinter realisation that a previously underwhelming campaign needed rescuing. “We made a decision halfway through the season that we all needed to buy into the way we’re going to play and really get after it,” says Randall. “There’s a few things we really focus on. One is our mindset and saying: ‘Right, we’re going to go after teams and have a real crack at them.’ The second is honing our skills. If we’re going to play a certain brand of rugby our skills need to be up to the test. It puts a lot of responsibility on the individual to knuckle down and nail what you need to do.”. It also happens to suit Randall’s game perfectly. When he last started for England, in the 2022 Six Nations, there was not the same licence to attack that has latterly emerged but he senses rugby may be coming back around to his way of thinking. “Over the past few years the kicking game has been the way to play rugby. South Africa have won two World Cups doing it and you can’t knock it. But I think teams are now trying to be a bit more attacking. I think it’s important for the future of the game. It’s all about spectators and you want to get bums on seats. You want people to be excited and to draw in the crowds.”. If the fourth-placed Bears can keep it going – “We’ve managed to get ourselves into a good spot” – it will also enhance Randall’s chances of touring with England this summer. Having grown up in the Amman Valley he represented Welsh age-group sides but his parents are English and his desire to play Test rugby remains as strong as ever.Sign up to The Breakdown.

I’m still only 26 … I’ve got plenty of years left in me. I want to play for England as many times as possible. There’s only so much I can control but the better I prepare and perform for Bristol week in, week out will give me the best opportunity to be selected.”. A sobering reminder of just how suddenly lives can change arrived this week following the stabbing incident at Ysgol Dyffryn Aman, the same school where he was once a student. “When I found out I rang my mum because they live only 10 minutes away. Of all the places it could have happened you wouldn’t have thought it would have been in that area. It’s very sad.”. This weekend, though, his primary focus – some quality sleep aside – is on keeping Bristol buzzing. “A lot of it is down to momentum and, fortunately, we’re in a good spot. Things aren’t always going to go right but we’re riding the wave really well.” Allow Randall the twin luxuries of time and space and the Tigers will be toast."

We were lacking this in the first 20 minutes and when we woke up it was already almost too late.“But the race is not over. Nothing is over. We are in the chasing role since gameday one and one thing’s for sure, we never give up. As long as we have a chance, I’m far away from giving up.”. This was always a deceptively difficult test, with QPR a team transformed since Martí Cifuentes took over in October. If Leeds’ attempt to escape the second flight had been turbocharged by a run of exceptional results since the turn of the year, QPR conjured a similar surge to avoid an entirely unwanted departure from the division. A notional 2024 Championship table might have Leeds at the top, but these three points would put the Hoops in the top six.“First of all, target achieved,” Cifuentes said. “That was the main thing. It was a really special night. I saw the bravery, in the way we wanted to attack, even in the last minutes of the game trying to press high. And then of course the togetherness. The connection with the supporters was amazing.”. They were excellent from the off, and alarm bells should have been clanging for Leeds as early as the sixth minute, when Chris Willock won the ball well inside his own half and surged stylishly if much too frictionlessly past a succession of half-hearted challenges until, just outside the Leeds penalty area, he overhit his pass to Dykes.Two minutes later the home side took the lead. Chair carried the ball into Leeds’ half, allowed their defence to be distracted by Kenneth Paal’s overlapping run, cut inside and sent in a shot from 20 yards that clipped Joe Rodon’s shoulder and deflected beyond Illan Meslier.Sign up to Football Daily.

Chair could soon have scored another, but he slashed over the bar from 15 yards after Andersen’s free-kick was half cleared. Then in the 22nd minute, after a throw-in on the right, Andersen befuddled Ilia Gruev with a drop of the shoulder, cut infield and curled an unstoppable shot into the far corner.Leeds recovered a little from there, and perhaps the game turned in the 32nd minute when Wilfried Gnonto’s cross dropped to an unmarked Crysencio Summerville at the far post. With time and space to pick his spot the Dutchman, by general acclaim the Championship’s outstanding player this season, chose Asmir Begovic’s chest.Beyond that the only thing Begovic had to do in the first half, beyond catching a few crosses, was a fine if fairly routine low stop from Joël Piroe’s left-footed shot.Though Leeds started the second period with a bit more vigour they struggled to translate it into a genuine goal threat, and when a chance finally came, a low cross from the left finding Georginio Rutter in space eight yards out, the Frenchman swung his left foot as if it belonged to a complete stranger and sent the ball bobbling wide. In the 66th minute the substitute Mateo Joseph turned Junior Firpo’s cross goalwards, Begovic deflected it behind with an outstretched foot, and that was the last time Leeds seriously threatened.Seven minutes later Chair’s left-wing corner was met by Dykes, whose header bounced between Meslier’s legs on its way into the net. With four minutes to play and Leeds long resigned to their fate Chair sent in a free-kick from the right and Meslier could only palm Field’s header into the top corner."

It is always there in the hard drive. For this time of the season, at the end it is about finding a way to win the game. And that is it. You can do it in various ways when you look at how they won the titles and how they won certain games with very very, very close margins. He always talked about that, about the fine margins. And who is going to step up on the occasion to make it happen.”. A picture of Arsenal’s players that includes the current sporting director, Edu, celebrating their title on the pitch at White Hart Lane hangs on the wall outside the press conference room at the club’s training ground. Arteta was asked whether his side, who registered a first win at Tottenham’s new stadium last season after three successive defeats, could take inspiration from one of Arsenal’s most famous days.“I understand that, but that’s not going to happen mathematically, even if we do win it,” he said. “But there are moments, obviously, that are very important in our history and I am sure that a lot of players know about it.

We were not even close to what we want to be. Somehow it happened that we didn’t see the positivity in the situation any more, that we have a good starting point, so let’s go and chase the others. But you can only chase in a positive way.“You saw the game. It wasn’t the first [poor] one but it was the worst one. Crystal Palace wasn’t even close. I see two teams [Arsenal and Manchester City] who play really positive football and go for it. We can do that but we don’t in this moment. Who can I make responsible for that? It’s my job until the last day to make sure the boys feel that.“The game was just horrible to watch. In Germany when the crowd is not happy with the team and think they are not fighting enough they sing ‘Wir wollen euch kämpfen sehen’ which translates as ‘We want to see you fight’. I was close to singing that! Never has one of my teams heard that ever. Never. I never heard them say my team didn’t fight because my team always went for it. And now, wow, how can that happen?”.

The Premier League is 38 rounds, 20 clubs, 180 games, it’s played between August and May, it hasn’t changed shape. What has changed … is the march of international and regional football competitions.“When you do change the calendar, it naturally has an impact. Obviously there have been decisions taken recently about a Club World Cup coming in 2025, but there hasn’t really been consultation with the leagues. We’ve worked very well with Uefa. We have a seat on the executive committee, we are working under a memorandum of understanding. The situation at Fifa is very different. There’s a difference between Uefa [where there is consultation] and Fifa, where there is none.”. Masters was speaking at the general assembly of the European Leagues organisation a week after the Premier League struck a deal with the FA to scrap FA Cup replays: an attempt by the top flight to streamline a calendar already set to grow thanks to the expansion of Uefa’s club competitions next season.The Club World Cup, or Mundial de Clubs Fifa, will run from 15 June-13 July next summer and is seen by European football administrators as a new strike in an attempt to shake up the traditional forms of the game. Set to feature 32 teams, with Manchester City and Chelsea already confirmed as participants, Premier League officials are concerned over the impact a competitive tournament in the summer break will have over the subsequent season.It is currently scheduled to take place every four years but there are concerns that the frequency of the tournament may also increase. The European Leagues have no formal relationship with Fifa, while the European Club Association (ECA) renewed its memorandum of understanding with the global governing body last year.Alongside his European colleagues Masters also focused on improving the video assistant referee system. He said he believed English officials were “doing a very good job”, despite the criticism they have recently come under from the league’s own clubs, most recently Nottingham Forest. But he said the video refereeing system “needs to improve. Part of that is getting the rules to be upgraded so there’s more space to communicate with fans.”. Sign up to Football Daily.

On the issue of the unprecedented charges against Manchester City, issued in February 2023 but which are waiting to be heard, Masters said: “The date has been set, and the case will resolve itself [at some] point in the near future. I can’t make any further comments on it.”. "

I don’t think that would be healthy for the player or for us.”. Although Howe is desperate to build his team around Guimarães, the clause dictates that should anyone be prepared to pay £100m, that sum will be included in Newcastle’s 2023-24 accounts. This means it could be used to boost their summer spending while keeping the club on the right side of Premier League profitability and sustainability rules.With potential buyers having only a relatively short window to activate the clause, Howe is cautiously optimistic that despite admiring glances from, among others, Paris Saint-Germain, Manchester City and Manchester United, Guimarães will be part of his squad next season.Should anyone try in July or August to buy a player who cost £35m from Lyon and has four years on his deal, Newcastle will be able to deter them by inflating the price significantly.Howe is well aware that Guimarães is a regular passenger on the frequent Air France flights between Newcastle and Paris but he is not convinced the 26-year-old’s heart is necessarily set on a move to PSG. “We want to keep Bruno,” he said. “We want to build our team around him. He’s an integral part of what we’re doing. His form has been very good. He seems very happy and settled here. He’s a big part of where we can hopefully take the team. But we’re not in control of that so we shall see.”. Should Newcastle secure a place in next season’s Europa League, Guimarães may be tempted to remain at the £4m house he has purchased in Northumberland, and Howe is hoping their European qualification campaign will be revived at home to Sheffield United on Saturday after Wednesday’s 2-0 defeat at Crystal Palace.Sign up to Football Daily.

Poor results often prompt Howe to indulge in a spot of meditation. “I’d say I meditate infrequently, now and then, depending on what results are like,” he said. “If we’re going through a bad spell I might be meditating a little more. I use an app and tend to do 10 minutes at a time. I’m well aware of the benefits of meditation and going into that sort of world. And I’m fully supportive of players who want to go into it.”. "

Yet Guardiola, asked about Foden’s form, said the 23-year-old still needed to be calmer during certain moments in games.“I would love him to go in sixth gear in every single action but afterwards you are less precise, you lose the ball all the time and that is not effective,” Guardiola said. “You have to reduce the time so you know the moments when you have to be more aggressive and calm.“But it’s a question of time. He can improve a lot and has improved a lot from the beginning of the season and from the previous seasons.” Guardiola then said with a smile: “Maybe with the third kid that is coming for his family, that will help him.”. Foden will be a candidate to win player of the year awards. “He is one of them,” Guardiola said. “But I have a feeling what he wants is [to win] the Premier League.”. City’s victory at Brighton took them above Liverpool into second place, one point behind Arsenal, having played a game fewer. They travel to Nottingham Forest on Sunday.After Forest’s 2-0 loss at Everton, the club issued a statement which questioned the integrity of Stuart Attwell, the video assistant referee, after he did not make referrals to the on-pitch referee, Anthony Taylor, over three incidents that the Nottingham club believed should have been penalties. Forest employ the former Premier League referee Mark Clattenburg as an adviser and Guardiola was asked whether he would ever want a similar consultant.“I go to the game and I never, ever know who is the referee,” he said. “The first time I know is when I see their face and I go: ‘Oh, I remember that face.’.

Jonathan Liew articulates much of what I have been saying for a while (For Sheffield United and co the Premier League brings a unique brew of misery, 23 April). The Premier League should no longer be viewed as the promised land for Championship clubs. The often morally dubious money of the large clubs has now distorted things so much that promotion is a hiding to nothing. And in the case of my beloved Sheffield United, it’s done so much damage to the club’s image that I feel we should probably sue the Premier League.When you’re from Sheffield, you have a sense of the history of the game.

There’s a real sense that the Premier League bandwagon has now become an unethical and unwieldy beast for the few hugely monied clubs to play with.“In hindsight it is increasingly clear that the six Super League clubs should probably have been allowed to go,” says Liew. I agree. In fact, let them break away now. We can enjoy the overpaid show ponies on TV, with VAR and Man United perennial underperformers, of course. I’ve been warning a friend who’s a Villa fan that they may get invited to join. Such a league will need the likes of the Villans to chuck up the odd result that makes it interesting, but mainly to be there as cannon fodder who lose most weeks.Thankfully, it’s back to the Championship for us. With a hope that Wednesday stay up, Leeds stay down and the EFL break away from the Prem. Then all will be well, as long as we don’t get promoted.John RigbySheffield.  As a lifelong Sheffield United fan and season ticket holder, I found Jonathan Liew’s article to be right on the money – if you’ll excuse the pun. This has been a terrible season for us Blades and never has the gap between the haves and the have-nots been so great. We have-nots simply don’t have the resources to compete with billionaire-owned clubs and sportswashing projects. Occasionally we might scrape our “best” 11 together and kid ourselves we’re in with a shout for 90 minutes. But then the Fergie time board magically displays 10-plus minutes, our moneyed opponents bring on £150m of box-fresh talent and it’s literally game over.And then there’s the unconscious bias of officials to contend with. Game after game you see the big players and big clubs get decisions in their favour. Refs clearly want to stay onside with Pep, Mikel and co, and don’t really care if Wilder or Kompany are screaming at them – they won’t be seeing them again any time soon for a sandwich.I knew we were going to be relegated from the moment we went up. We effectively have about 15 teams in the promised land for life and then a few tokenistic others dropping in and out, like state school kids at Oxbridge, so the Premier League can cynically suggest that’s it’s not a closed shop for the elite.Geoff LoveWest Bridgford, Nottinghamshire.  Manchester City’s wage budget this season is around 10 times that of Sheffield United, which in turn is around 10 times that of Oxford United – who are in League One. Yet Sheffield United are expected to compete against the likes of Man City every week. In no fair sport could there ever be such grotesque financial inequality between two teams competing in the same league.If it wasn’t already hard enough to bridge that gap, top teams now have the luxury of bringing five world-class players off the bench, VAR decisions that disproportionately benefit them, and copious added-on time (just in case they weren’t already winning). Abolishing FA Cup replays is the latest concession granted to big clubs that will only exacerbate this financial chasm.Competing at the top is now impossible unless you’re backed by an unscrupulous US businessman or a murderous Middle East regime. This isn’t the football I fell in love with. This isn’t my football.Nick HarlandSheffield.  As a Burnley fan, all I can say to Ipswich fans is that you must believe what Jonathan Liew is trying to tell you: “that this – right here – is the good bit. With a team they adore and a league they are tearing apart and a coach who is theirs and theirs alone. Not the grim struggle that comes after.” Never has just a tiny part of an article expressed my feelings of last season and this so succinctly.Hazel LeachSale, Greater Manchester.

Gukesh Dommaraju became, at 17, the youngest ever Candidates ­winner and world championship challenger on Sunday after edging out the favourites Fabiano Caruana, Hikaru Nakamura and Ian Nepomniachtchi in a marathon six-hour final round in Toronto.Gukesh will now meet the holder, China’s Ding Liren, in a 14-game series for the world crown from 20 November to 15 December. The world No 1, Norway’s Magnus Carlsen, abdicated his title in 2023 after a 10-year reign.The Chennai teenager started the 14th and final round half a point ahead of his three rivals, and had the better of a draw with Nakamura, the USA’s world No 3. Caruana, the USA’s world No 2, had the chance to force a tie and a speed playoff, but failed to convert his winning position against Russia’s Nepomniachtchi. Their game lasted 109 moves and six hours before Caruana abandoned his attempts to make progress in what was by then a dead drawn ending.The American and the Russian have fought for the crown for the best part of a decade, and their mutual disappointment brought out a camaraderie between them, as shown in a video of the final moments of their game. “Really sorry,” says Nepomniachtchi. “My fault,” replies Caruana.Final leading scores were Gukesh 9/14, Caruana, Nakamura and Nepomniachtchi all 8.5, Praggnanandhaa Rameshbabu (India) 7.Gukesh’s victory is a historic achievement. Until now, teenagers have had an indifferent record in the Candidates. Only Bobby Fischer in 1959 and Carlsen in 2006, both then 16, have been younger than Gukesh, and both were also-rans.Garry Kasparov, who was the ­previous youngest Candidates winner at 20, called the result “an Indian earthquake in Toronto” and added “the children of Vishy Anand are on the loose” in a reference to India’s previous world champion, who mentored Gukesh and is his chess hero.Gukesh’s career has been marked by a consistent rapid advance since 2019, when he became a grandmaster at 12 years seven months, the third youngest in history after Abhimanyu Mishra of the US and Sergey Karjakin of Russia. It was then that his family decided to support him as a professional player, despite the financial risks involved. Later, he was the youngest ever to achieve a 2750 rating, and he won the individual top board gold medal at the 2022 Olympiad. He qualified for the Candidates by finishing top of the Fide Circuit, a league table of major tournaments.A secret of his success has been his calmness and equanimity under pressure. Away from the board, he likes to play outdoor sports, with tennis his favourite. He regularly practices yoga, which helps his stamina. He remarked that, despite his lack of experience, his youth was a strength for such a long tournament: “It’s easier to be focused at my age.”. Gukesh’s only loss at Toronto was to Alireza Firouzja in round six, when he collapsed in time pressure and his despair was captured on video. Yet from that moment his self-belief in winning the tournament grew: “I was upset, but during the rest day I felt so good that the loss gave me motivation.”. His second, the Polish grandmaster Grzegorz Gajewski, who worked with Anand for many years, said: “Anand is the brilliant one, who sees it first, but Gukesh is the calm one, who managed to keep his composure even in the most stressful moments. Apart from being a brilliant player, this is the main thing that decided the tournament.”. There was only half a point in it at the finish. Gukesh drew all six games against his principal rivals, but, critically, won with both colours against the outclassed tailender, Nijat Abasov, who dealt Nepomniachtchi’s chances a blow by drawing twice. Nakamura’s nemesis was Vidit Gujrathi, who twice crushingly defeated the popular streamer.The 36-year-old brushed it all off two days later, when he scored a clean sweep of this week’s Titled Tuesday, opening with 1 h4 in several games. He has now won the event 71 times.Many would argue that the World Cup, a 150-player knockout qualifying three Candidates, and the Grand Swiss, with over 100 players and qualifying two, are over-represented and should have fewer places, and that the Fide Circuit, which rewards the winners of high-class tournaments, should have more than one. Gukesh qualified from the Circuit and Caruana would have done so had he not already secured a place by another route.The coming Ding v Gukesh match for the world crown, which will take place from 20 November to 15 December, will be the first all-Asian title match. Ding’s indifferent form in recent months means that the challenger will start favourite to break Kasparov’s record as the youngest world champion by four years, but there is a caveat.Sign up to The Recap. The best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action. after newsletter promotion. In an interview, Ding praised his rival: “He has a maturity that doesn’t match his age, and he has his own unique understanding of the position … He is a difficult opponent to face.” But he added: “I have the advantage in classical chess.”. Ding is referring to their only two head-to-head classical games, at Tata Steel Wijk aan Zee in 2023 and 2024, where in both cases the Chinese player trounced his opponent with the black pieces.Months before his world title challenge, the Candidates winner has another important date – from 8 to 12 May at the Grand Chess Tour Rapid and Blitz in Warsaw, Poland, where the 10-player field includes both Gukesh and Carlsen.China’s Tan Zhongyi won the women’s Candidates, and will now meet her compatriot Ju Wenjun for the world title. Leaders were Tan 9/14, Lei Tingjie (China), Koneru Humpy and Vaishali Rameshbabu (both India) all 7.5.Tan, 32, and born on 29 May, the same day of the year as Gukesh, was a highly convincing winner who led from start to finish and lost only once. She revealed afterwards that she did not expect to win, as competitive chess is no longer her main priority. Instead, she has her own club and coaches talented students.Her past achievements already include a world championship, which she won in 2017, when the event was staged as a knockout. In 2018 she lost a title match 4.5-5.5 to Ju, who has held the crown ever since, and will be the favourite in their rematch due to her good performance at Wijk aan Zee earlier this year. Tan’s best win at Toronto featured a classic king’s side attack.The other eyecatching result in the women’s Candidates was by Vaishali Rameshbabu, sister of Praggnanandhaa, who was fifth in the open event.

His next project, however, is a world away from Disney dreams.The Tattooist of Auschwitz is Sky’s epic drama taken from Heather Morris’s bestselling 2018 novel. The book is based on the real story of Lali Sokolov (Hauer-King), a Slovakian Jew who is given the job of tattooing numbers on to fellow prisoners in the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp. He tattoos and falls in love with Gita Furman (Anna Próchniak), and they both manage to survive and find each other again.It is a harrowing and deeply upsetting watch. And yet there are rare, precious moments of hope in its love story. Hauer-King, an early fan of the book, spent hours speaking with executive producer Claire Mundell to ensure the story was in a respectful and protective pair of hands.“The first thing I did was go back to Auschwitz [he first visited it as a teenager], to pay my respects and approach it as an adult,” he says of his year-long deep research. “But also to approach it more in the context of the story we were telling.”. The three-month shoot in Slovakia was tough. “It was always going to be quite draining,” says Hauer-King. The most shocking moment came when many of the cast had to shave off their hair. “In any other context, it can be quite an innocuous thing to do – it’s sort of just a haircut,” he says. “But knowing why they shaved people’s heads, why they wanted to dehumanise people and take away their identity … Having been something I was quite matter-of-fact about, when I actually came to do it and saw myself in the mirror, it was so poignant. I wasn’t expecting that.”. Despite its global success, the story received criticism regarding its authenticity: the Auschwitz Memorial Research Centre claimed that numerous historical details of the camp are wrong. Morris has always said that the book, based on months of interviews with 87-year-old Lali in 2003, isn’t an academic piece of non-fiction, and says “95% of it is as it happened, researched and confirmed”. It is Lali’s story, she told the New York Times: “I make mention of history and memory waltzing together and straining to part, it must be accepted after 60 years this can happen but I am confident of Lali’s telling of his story, only he could tell it and others may have a different understanding of that time but that is their understanding, I have written Lali’s.”. In the series, this is addressed by having Morris (Melanie Lynskey) meet and speak to the older Lali (Harvey Keitel), who tells his story through flashbacks. Hauer-King says that Morris, who executive produces on the show, was very open to taking the novel as a blueprint and doing more research on every point of the story. Still, does he worry about a similar backlash?. “Yeah definitely,” he is quick to answer. “When you tell a story like that, on the one hand you want to make sure that everything is being done to ensure authenticity. On the other hand, we were aware that we’re not trying to tell a definitive story of the Holocaust and it is definitely one man’s story.”. The timing of such a show is another contentious point. When journalists were first invited to watch clips of the drama in a London hotel last November, Israeli director Tali Shalom Ezer joined over video as she couldn’t fly because of the crisis in the Middle East. Jonathan Glazer’s recent Oscar-winning Auschwitz film The Zone of Interest proved how powerful screen stories are in provoking uncomfortable but essential discourse on current conflicts. Hauer-King agrees: “That’s so important. They really have a significant part to play. I don’t think they’re there to replace other mediums like documentary.”. Still, there is a baffling moment when I mention that he signed an Artists for Palestine UK open letter alongside Tilda Swinton, Charles Dance and Steve Coogan, calling for a Gaza ceasefire last October. “Oh actually, I haven’t. I didn’t know about that,” he says in surprise. “Tell me about the letter.” He adds: “That’s not to say that I wouldn’t have [signed it], but no I don’t think I have.” (His name still appears on the list at the time of writing and his team have since declined to add further comment on record.). Hauer-King has a remarkable family history – his Jewish grandparents fled Poland for Canada between the wars in 1929. “They went on the SS Lituania, which took you across the Atlantic to Halifax,” he says excitedly. “We recently found all of the records and photographs of [my grandad]. It is an extraordinary story. His grandparents, who he didn’t come with, had been sending letters intermittently for years … and then they just stopped.”. The influence of this is strong. Fans of the brilliant drama World on Fire will recognise Hauer-King as Harry Chace – a young translator who finds himself in a love triangle when he is sent to Poland. He also starred with Clive Owen and Tim Roth in François Girard’s adaptation of The Song of Names, following a Polish orphan after the second world war. “Identity and who we are, where we come from and our past history through family – it’s something I’ve always been really fascinated by,” he says. When he told his mother about the role of Lali, she had mixed feelings: “She felt very proud that I was making something that felt really meaningful, but also shared my feeling of how important it was to take care of this story and what a responsibility it was.”. Hauer-King grew up in Camden; his mother, Debra Hauer, was a theatre producer and his restaurateur father, Jeremy King, co-owned the company behind the Wolseley. He originally wanted to be an indie rock star, playing guitar in a band called Rova. “It was probably the happiest days of my life, gigging around north London venues like the Lexington,” he laughs. Were they any good? “I always say: ‘Oh, we were rubbish.’ But then I think I’m just saying that … I was proud of it at the time!”. Sign up to What's On.

He went to Eton and studied theology and religious studies at Cambridge University, but then pursued acting as a career. The dominance of the privately educated in the arts looms large, but he is refreshingly up for talking about it with total acceptance. “I was at a school where drama was taken so seriously – you were literally given a stage. I was allowed to explore that. And that was where I fell in love with it. I think you need to own it and put your hands up and say: ‘This is a very real problem and this is something you have benefited from.’ To deny that you’ve been given a huge leg up? It could be quite insulting.”. This formative privilege may explain why he seems so grounded and unchanged as he breaks Hollywood and launches one of the biggest dramas of the year. He still lives in Camden and would never move to Los Angeles. “A lot of my friends aren’t actors; when you’re here, you’re surrounded by a million people doing different things and I really like that,” he says. “London for me still represents home away from work. I wonder if the lines would be blurred a bit more in somewhere like LA.”. Plus, he’s got that football season ticket to make the most of. Although, he says: “When I was filming Tattooist, one way I tried to take myself away from the shoot was to watch Arsenal. It was this time last year, when I was confident they’d do it [win the Premier League], but it started going downhill. Now I’m much more hands off. I’m not going to make any bold statements.”. Right now, he has the Tattooist premiere to attend, where he will meet his co-stars Keitel and Lynskey for the first time. “The realities of filming production and scheduling meant I didn’t [meet them], which was devastating. I love them both so much! And now I’ve watched it and they are both extraordinary in it.”. Hauer-King is a busy man after that. He stars as Giacomo Casanova in upcoming film A Beautiful Imperfection, which centres on Casanova’s great love, Lucia. He’s also filming Doctor Who next month (he is very tight-lipped on any details) and reading a lot of scripts so he can pick his next project wisely. But his Disney days are firmly behind him.“The Little Mermaid was really different to anything I’ve ever done. There was so much going on around you; our director called it the circus. You can’t believe the scale of it when you walk on the sets – a rainforest set, a boat set, or flying to Sardinia and being on a beach,” he says. “But I’ve just made another film where you walk on set and it’s a living room … It would feel restrictive to do the exact same kind of thing again.”. “When you do a job like Tattooist, you know not every job is going to feel that meaningful,” he says. “But you also realise how incredible a job it can be, if you wait for the right one to come along.”. The Tattooist of Auschwitz is on Sky Atlantic, 2 May at 9pm. "

One of the great alter egos in pop could be meeting a grisly end, as Eminem announces his first album since 2020: The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grâce).Set for release on an unspecified date this summer, the album was announced with a trailer that frames the demise of the antic character, with a crime reporter saying to camera: “Through his complex and oft-criticised tongue-twisting rhymes, the anti-hero known as Slim Shady has had no shortage of enemies … rude lyrics and controversial antics may have ultimately led to his demise.”. 50 Cent appears, describing Slim Shady – with mock fear – as a psychopath, and Eminem himself concludes: “I knew it was only a matter of time for Slim.” An image, possibly the album artwork, features a figure with a knife wound to the chest.THE DEATH OF SLIM SHADY (COUP DE GRÂCE). Summer 2024. https://t.co/J3F45PQDLx pic.twitter.com/tdJ4d4PzV0. Eminem created the character in 1997 to help energise him after the failure of his debut album Infinite the previous year. Beginning with a horror-movie intro where Slim Shady takes over Eminem’s body, The Slim Shady EP made its way to mogul Jimmy Iovine and then Dr Dre, who began a partnership that resulted in Eminem’s mainstream breakthrough, The Slim Shady LP (1999).Slim Shady was a foul-mouthed, horny, cartoonishly disgusting provocateur who was introduced to the wider world with the single My Name Is, and its opening couplet: “Hi, kids, do you like violence? / Wanna see me stick nine-inch nails through each one of my eyelids?”. Eminem used the character to rabble-rouse pop culture, with crass lines about stars including Christina Aguilera, and delivering “horrorcore” storytelling full of violence and gross-out humour. Singles including Without Me, The Real Slim Shady and Just Lose It featured the character and became major commercial hits.With his nasal delivery, Slim Shady also became part of a multi-voice split personality, with Eminem also using his real name Marshall Mathers to express more sober material such as his classic story of fan obsession Stan, and “Eminem” a kind of bridge between the two. There was drama in the way the rapper seemed torn between the different sides of his personality, but by 2008 Eminem wrote in his memoir: “Slim, Em, and Marshall are always in the mix when I’m writing now. I’ve found a way to morph the styles so that it’s sort of all me.”. Eminem then leaned more towards the downbeat side of his craft for a number of years, particularly in the wake of drug addiction on albums such as Relapse (2009) and Recovery (2010).But on recent LPs – Kamikaze (2018) and Music to Be Murdered By (2020), each of them surprise-released – he has played again with the more provocative side of his artistry. He caused controversy with the Music to Be Murdered By track Unaccommodating by – very Slim Shady-ishly – comparing himself to the terrorist who bombed an Ariana Grande concert at Manchester Arena in 2017, killing 22.The Guardian’s Alexis Petridis said of Kamikaze: “Hip-hop’s former enfant terrible, a man who made a career out of saying things that even his most nihilistic peers would consider beyond the pale … reinvented himself as rap’s grumpy dad, baffled and horrified at what the genre had become.”. Petridis said that on that album and its successor, Eminem was “going through the motions” with his Slim Shady provocations, but acknowledged that Music to Be Murdered By “offers one virtuoso performance after another: delivery that’s both warp-speed and perfectly enunciated, constant shifts in tempo and emphasis”.Including his greatest hits collection Curtain Call – which has spent 614 weeks on the chart and is still currently inside the Top 20 – the new album will very probably become Eminem’s 11th UK No 1 in a row. That would put him on an equal footing with Taylor Swift, U2, and David Bowie who also have 11 chart-toppers each (though Swift will surely add a 12th later today), while the Beatles remain top with 15.Alongside the album announcement, Eminem appeared at an event announcing this year’s NFL draft picks, held in the rapper’s home city of Detroit."

Swedish film-maker Ruben Östlund has seemingly made it his life’s work to satirise the bourgeoisie – from the nuclear family in meltdown in Force Majeure to the pretentious art-world crowd of The Square. In this out-there comedy, he takes aim at the fashion industry via two models, Carl (Harris Dickinson) and Yaya (Charlbi Dean). Vain, petty and insecure, the couple go on an Insta-worthy trip on a luxury yacht alongside a group of super-rich types. But they find themselves all at sea – in more ways than one – after a disastrous storm flips the power dynamic between the guests and the put-upon staff. Come for the extended vomiting scene, stay for the class war. Saturday 27 April, Netflix. “Good writers borrow … The great writers steal.” These words from celebrated novelist JM Sinclair (Richard E Grant, fun to watch as ever) resonate through Alice Troughton’s sly mystery. Daryl McCormack’s would-be author Liam moves into his literary hero’s home to tutor his teenage son, under the eye of Sinclair’s wife Hèléne (a gnomic Julie Delpy). Schemes and secrets swirl around Liam, alongside debates on creativity and originality. The question of whose narrative will prevail keeps the tale simmering nicely. Saturday 27 April, 9.20am, 4pm, Sky Cinema Premiere. Less is more in Doug Liman’s 2002 masterpiece. Taking the Mission: Impossible thriller template and stripping out all the high-tech, stunt-heavy action scenes unexpectedly makes the film more exciting. And casting Matt Damon as amnesiac spy-on-the-run Jason Bourne gives the main character an everyman vibe that serves the story well. More likely to have a scrap in a kitchen than wreck a runaway train, the resourceful Bourne is a hero Le Carré may have recognised – and set a new benchmark for modern espionage heroes. Wednesday 1 May, 6pm, Sky Cinema Greats. In this slick romantic drama from The Big Sick director Michael Showalter, the always effervescent Anne Hathaway plays LA art gallery owner and divorcee Solène. When she takes her teenage daughter Izzy (Ella Rubin) to Coachella she has a meet-cute with English boyband star Hayes (Nicholas Galitzine). Despite the 16-year age gap they fall in love, but the level of his fame – and the social media fallout – causes difficulties for their relationship. With big Notting Hill vibes (minus the comedy), the film aims skilfully for the swooning heart of its target audience. Thursday 2 May, Prime Video. Sign up to What's On.

In 2006, Alan Bennett’s Tony-laden play was turned into a terrific film by Nicholas Hytner (an interview between the two follows this screening). Suffused with Bennett’s brand of ambivalent nostalgia, it follows eight sixth-form students at a Sheffield grammar school (played by the likes of Dominic Cooper, James Corden and Russell Tovey) as they are tutored for the entrance exams for Oxbridge, with teacher Hector (a moving Richard Griffiths) the prime mover in trying to expand their teenage minds. Thursday 2 May, 10pm, BBC Four. Rose Glass’s second film, sapphic thriller Love Lies Bleeding, hits cinemas this week so here’s her debut feature to prep you for that. It’s an astonishing psychological horror about a palliative care nurse – and extremely devout Catholic – Maud (an extraordinary performance from a pre-Tolkein Morfydd Clark), who vows to save the soul of her client, terminally ill choreographer Amanda (Jennifer Ehle). But are her episodes of overwhelming religious ecstasy divine revelation or signs of a disintegrating mental state? Glass tantalises us throughout in a disturbing, gripping drama. Friday 3 May, 10.50pm, Film4. It’s “hereditary v environment” in John Landis’s 1983 comedy – but capitalism turns out to be the real winner. Commodity broker brothers Randolph (Ralph Bellamy) and Mortimer (Don Ameche) have a wager about what would happen if Eddie Murphy’s poor beggar Billy Ray swapped lives with entitled rich employee Louis (Dan Aykroyd). The sexual and racial politics are definitely “of its time” (pity Jamie Lee Curtis as sex worker Ophelia, who helps Louis), but Murphy’s comic skills are used to good effect as you cheer his plot to financially ruin the bigoted old men.

Charlie Croker is a boorish property developer who trusts his charisma and deal-making smarts will carry him through any crisis. Based on Tom Wolfe’s 1998 novel of the same name, the drama stars Croker (Jeff Daniels) as a more nuanced figure than the book’s Trumpian character. As his business falls apart and former allies turn against him, viewers might feel their sympathies split – the forces facing Croker feel just as absurd and malign as the man himself. The adaptation (which also stars Diane Lane and William Jackson Harper) doesn’t quite manage the state-of-the-nation heft of the novel. But it’s still a nicely satirical study of American hubris. Netflix, from Thursday 2 May. The isolation, arcane rituals and eccentric inhabitants of monasteries create a promising setting for drama. This adaptation of CJ Sansom’s historical mystery novel stars Arthur Hughes as Matthew Shardlake, a barrister turned investigator sent by Thomas Cromwell (Sean Bean) to shut down a Benedictine monastery and commandeer its assets. It’s a very personal assignment for Shardlake, who has kyphosis – curvature of the spine – and was told as a child that he could never be a priest as “God made us in his own image”. But he’s also a rationalist, trying to keep calm in the face of dogma and hysteria. Disney+, from Wednesday 1 May. The film spin-off of the era-defining Sonic the Hedgehog game grows an animated TV arm, with Idris Elba reprising his voice role as the comically serious and dangerously hot-tempered anthropomorphic echidna. After moving to Earth at the end of the last Sonic film, Knuckles attempts to adjust to life in the home of patient human host Maddie (Tika Sumpter). Knuckles is terrifyingly strong and doesn’t always use his powers for good – but he soon has a dimwitted disciple in the shape of Adam Pally’s deputy sheriff Wade Whipple. Paramount+, from Saturday 27 April. A knockabout French meta-comedy starring Pierre Niney as Raphaël Valande, a geeky, nervous first-time film director who is trying to shoot a cheesy but impossibly ambitious wartime epic as a tribute to his grandmother. However, as mishaps mount and another member of his team launches a coup, things start to unravel. Could salvation be at hand courtesy of a flashy but confident new investor? Almost certainly not. The comedy is surprisingly broad but it’s a fun premise and Valande is a likably befuddled lead. Netflix, from Tuesday 30 April. Sign up to What's On.

As we rejoin Jeremy Clarkson, he’s had a setback, as an official enforcement notice has ordered him to stop using any part of his property as a cafe. But he isn’t short of innovative ideas, even if they aren’t fully fleshed out. These include growing mushrooms, hoovering blackberries off their bushes and, perhaps more sensibly, giving Kaleb more responsibility. It’s daft, low-stakes fun but be prepared for a surprisingly heartbreaking incident with a very cute piglet. Prime Video, from Friday 3 May. As this hyper-glossy California reality series reaches its third season, the gargantuan real estate deals are increasingly little more than a backdrop to the high-octane personal drama as the members of the Oppenheim Group revel in their workplace entanglements. This time, expect much of the action to revolve round Alex and Tyler, whose prospective romance seems to have hit the buffers. It’s also clear that Austin and Sean are embarking upon a flamboyant feud. A few beachfront properties get sold, too, but that’s largely beside the point. Netflix, from Friday 3 May. Rob McElhenney and Ryan Reynolds’s footballing odyssey returns for a third season. And even though it’s sometimes hard to completely buy into the underdog narrative (the wealth of these men is essentially a cheat code for a club at Wrexham’s level), it’s tough not to be seduced anyway. After all, as Reynolds wisely puts it: “People expected to see a documentary about us changing Wrexham. But instead, it’s a documentary about Wrexham changing everyone else.” As we rejoin them, the club is finally back in the football league. But can it make the step up? Disney+, from Friday 3 May. "

Coral bracelets, kitsch keyrings and shell necklaces are some of this season’s most covetable accessories.Anya Hindmarch has brought the holiday mood to west London with a pop-up shop that she describes as “a love letter to the classic souvenir shops you find tucked away in favourite holiday destinations”.The facade is covered in vintage tiling and a retro awning while inside there is everything from fridge magnets to rolls of Kodak Gold film interspersed among Hindmarch’s classic raffia tote bags, and upcycled shirts by the London brand Pikol using Spanish souvenir glass cloths.Meanwhile, the accessories sections of fast-fashion retailers such as Zara are peppered with riffs on ceramic shell necklaces and coral-effect bracelets.Balenciaga’s latest it-bag, The Rodeo, comes adorned with a cacophony of charms, including a tasselled door key fob – evoking that sudden realisation that you forgot to return it on checkout – alongside garish dolphin- and heart-shaped keyrings – similar to those bought from a beachside stand to placate a child.Of course, one person’s tat has always been another’s treasure. As the author Lucy Lethbridge notes, souvenirs are rooted in ideas around taste. “I mean, 50 years ago it may be that tourists took home kitsch things because they thought they were beautiful,” she says. “Nowadays, the young know that kitsch is kitsch but it’s very knowing, it’s a sort of camp aesthetic which is popular.”. While Balenciaga’s souvenir-inspired look costs £8,500, on TikTok users have got to work emulating it on the cheap. Scouting out beaten up bags from vintage sites, there are detailed tutorials on how to “Jane Birkin-ify” them, a reference to the actor who was known for covering the Hermès Birkin bag she inspired with cheap trinkets and Free Tibet stickers.Pop stars, including Dua Lipa and Lily Allen, have joined the trend of adorning bags with tchotchkes. On the secondhand platform Depop, searches for bag charms this month are up 29%.Sign up to Fashion Statement.

Henrik Lischke, Grazia’s senior fashion features editor, says part of the trend’s appeal is that it adds a unique element to the wearer’s look. Lischke, who describes himself as “a souvenir superfan”, likes to wear chunky beaded necklaces he picked up for €10 on the Greek island of Hydra, and a feathered brooch he found in the gift shop of the Fife Arms, in Scotland. “I love pieces that are specific to the area you find them in. They help add personality to a simple outfit. I’d much rather go to a souvenir shop than a luxury shopping mall.”. I-D’s global editorial director, Olivia Singer, has made an all-black wardrobe featuring sharp silhouettes from Marc Jacobs and Alaïa her signature, but it’s a pair of cheap Eiffel Tower-shaped earrings bought from a merch stand in Paris that she wears the most.Other favourites include a shell necklace from a beach holiday and a silver pyramid charm necklace from a trip to Egypt. “It’s a fine line between wearing souvenirs and dressing like Edina Monsoon, but it’s nice to wear nice memories of things,” says Singer.Pikol’s founder, Dan Branston, says he sourced the glass cloths from car boots, explaining that nostalgia is an important part of the trend. He favours a faded cloth. “It has more of a back story. It makes you think about the person that brought it back in their suitcase from a holiday.”. Lischke believes the trend is a wider backlash to the quiet luxury mood that has dominated fashion discourse. “Souvenirs aren’t minimalist but they do have forever appeal. People want to wear things that evoke joy. We are heading towards a loud fashion moment. Souvenirs are the first wave.”. "

Rishi Sunak appeared on his Instagram feed on Tuesday morning holding a mug emblazoned with the St George’s flag. “Perfect way to start the day,” was the caption: “Happy St George’s Day!”. It is not the only time the prime minister has raised a symbolic piece of teaware. On the same day he appeared en route to Warsaw holding a white mug marked only with the number “10”, presumably a reference to his current home address. Last year one enveloped in a union jack print was his choice for a trip to a Nato summit in Lithuania. Personal branding clearly pays no mind to international airspace.On other occasions, Sunak has been photographed with a gamut of branded company mugs, from a Selco one on a visit to a builders’ warehouse in London to a National Gas mug on a visit to the Bacton terminals in Norfolk.What is Sunak saying with these mugs? Because even on site visits, it is a deliberate choice to leave in frame a hot drink receptacle.“There is an imperative to signal that he is somewhat normal,” says the political journalist, and political mug collector, Stephen Bush, whose most recent acquisition was the “In Liz we Truss” mug that remained very much in stock at the end of the Tory party conference in 2022. “He’s signalling he’s an everyday person by doing something people do every day.”. Mugs are also, says Bush, a relatively low-key way of signalling patriotism where an outright flag “would be quite try-hard”. “They’re a good way of being like: ‘Oh yeah, look, I’m a normal guy. I love this country. Look at me drinking from my normal guy cup.’”. Sunak’s mugs have shifted tone. Last year the half-pint mug on his desk, alongside a celebratory slice of cake to mark one year in office, depicted five interlocked red Labradors; the work of the squarely middle-class brand Emma Bridgewater. As chancellor in 2020 it was a tech-bro-ish £180 smart mug that can set an exact drinking temperature.Bush thinks he is now trying to signal he is both more “everyman” and, “crucially, more manly”. His newer mugs are perhaps the crockery equivalent of the Timberland boots he wore to call for small-boat crossings of the Channel to be stopped.He wasn’t the first politician to mobilise teaware. Tony Blair was regularly pictured with a mug, using his casual appearance sipping from it to semaphore the sort of modernising tendencies upon which New Labour set out its stall. Bush notes that before the Blair years, in pictures of politicians meeting in Downing Street, everyone would be using cups and saucers. The mug, he says, was “part of a visual language of early New Labour … we’re modern and we’re different”.And mugs have long been the site of political slogans and campaigning – almost everyone uses them and it’s a low-stakes way of signalling allegiance. That doesn’t mean they always hit the mark. In 2015, Ed Miliband’s Labour released one promising “Controls on immigration”, which Bush wrote was “condemned as unspeakably naff at best and outright racist at worst”. He collected it as a “great physical reminder of the problems of that election campaign”.For most British politicians, the idea that even their most ardent supporters would wear a T-shirt declaring that support is a pipe dream – “Tony Blair in 1999 is maybe the last time that you might have been able to wear a T-shirt with a British politician on it without a derogatory slogan and still pull,” says Bush – a mug is a less full-throated mouthpiece.Boris Johnson is one former prime minister who knows what’s at stake with the wrong mug, having had a single-use plastic one snatched out of his hand by an aide worried about the optics at the Tory party conference in 2019. Michael Gove finally switched to reusables for his walks into Downing Street in 2019, remarkably late for a then-environment secretary supposedly waging war on plastic.In most cases it is impossible to tell what Sunak’s mug holds, unless he helpfully captions it, as he did on a trip to meet Ben Bradley MP in November last year, saying: “Met up for a cuppa in Worksop yesterday. We both agree that when the East Midlands succeeds, the whole country succeeds”. Tea feels like a safe assumption.“Tea itself carries a message of bringing people together, calming everybody down,” says the tea expert Jane Pettigrew, who points out that it contains L-theanine, “an amino acid, which actually calms us and de-stresses us”. It is “very much a drink of the people” and, with an election on the horizon,” she says, “he’s trying to win the public vote”.How could Sunak better leverage the power of the mug to win the heart of the nation? Considering the polls, Bush thinks he would be better off going back to Emma Bridgewater, instead of “trying to convince us all that he’s like some kind of gritty man of the people who uses the word ‘cuppa’”."

The statement sleeve has an origin story in the Zoom dressing lockdown era, but continues to go from strength to strength in 2024, with Bella Baxter’s bonkers sleeves helping power Emma Stone to an Oscar for Poor Things.But the most fashionable sleeve of all is a sleeve that isn’t there at all. The no sleeve is the new power sleeve. To be specific, what we are talking about here is the unstoppable rise of the sleeveless knit and the sleeveless jacket. Sleevelessness as a fashion statement works best on a jumper or a jacket precisely because they usually have sleeves. When you see a jumper without sleeves, or a blazer, the sleevelessness feels like a daring creative decision, whereas a shift dress without sleeves is just, well, a shift dress.Let me rewind for a minute, in case anyone needs to catch up. If you are asking yourself, wait, is she talking about tank tops, then the short answer is yes, and the slightly longer answer is yes but please do not let yourself down by using the term “tank tops” in public. Sleeveless knit or sweater, if you will. Or tabard, if it has a boxy shape and you want to be fancy.I’m a recent convert to the sleeveless knit and it is one of my most exciting new discoveries. Not quite as thrilling as Torres jamón ibérico crisps, but genuinely not far off. I didn’t used to get the point of sleeveless knits at all, to be honest. I used to think: if it’s a jumper, it needs sleeves, because when is it cold enough for a jumper but warm enough for bare arms?. But I was getting it all wrong. First, the sleeveless knit works brilliantly on top of lightweight layers, making flimsy dresses and filmy blouses viable for a longer season. Second, if your middle is toasty, bare arms are perfectly comfortable in middling weather. No, sorry, I don’t have time to investigate the science of this – we have serious fashion business to discuss – but it’s true.Even better than how the statement no-sleeve works is how it looks. The big statement sleeves tend to conjure up a period-drama kind of mood, which is fun and jolly, but really I would always prefer to look modern, and a sleeveless knit does that. Sleeveless knits are a little bit preppy in a wholesome, weekend-party-good-sport kind of way, but they are also a bit nerdy in a Prada kind of way, which stops them being too posh and smug.If you wear a sleeveless knit over a sleeved dress or blouse, then the conversation between the two pieces is where the magic happens. A cosy Fair Isle sleeveless knit will bring levity to a striped shirt, or, if you switch the roles around, a crisp and boxy tabard-style plain knit can sharpen up a floral dress. If you wear the sleeveless piece on its own, as a chunky vest, then the chic is served up in the clean vertical line from shoulder to hip, so it is most effective with a bottom half that elongates that line, meaning wide-legged trousers will be more impactful than leggings.If you’ve already mastered the sleeveless knit, then this summer’s advanced level fashion challenge is the sleeveless blazer. John Lewis have an elegant double-breasted version, £99, which could convert a fair few sceptics. The fanciest sleeve of the season doesn’t have a name, because it isn’t there.

Add beautiful bathrooms, Kool & The Gang and George Benson on the stereo, and lovely, chipper serving staff, and they clearly mean business here.Yet, as soon as our first plate arrived – a beautiful-looking Thai salad that on the very first forkful revealed itself to be a big mound of wildly under-dressed cabbage – alarm bells started to ring. If only the food offering were as ballsy as the decor. The “small plates” section of the menu lists chicken wings, edamame, iceberg lettuce salad and prawn or vegetable tempura, which makes a trip to Wagamama seem like a street-food jaunt with Anthony Bourdain. This menu seems to assume that its customers have only ever experienced “abroad” on Google Street View. The small plates menu also features a robata selection of chicken satay, grilled padrón peppers or lamb in ginger and black bean sauce.The menu then moves to steamed gyoza – I had the vegetable ones, which came swimming in soy and a black, sticky snot that was apparently truffle. Actually, truffle does a lot of heavy lifting on Sekoyya’s menu – it’s there in the miso truffle tagliatelle and on the truffle and parmesan fries, too. There are also Korean bao buns with miso crispy aubergine, hoisin chicken, peppered beef or grilled duck. They jammed my aubergine bao into a toast rack inside a bamboo basket, but the bun was of such poor quality that it couldn’t be extracted without disintegrating, by which time all the tempura batter had fallen off the aubergine and I began to suspect we were being filmed by TikTok pranksters.Sekkoya is a prime example of why the term “pan-Asian” fills me with such foreboding these days. In its original sense, the phrase meant a culinary extravaganza in which the chefs showed off their discoveries from the 23 provinces of China, with a few highlights from Vietnam, Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia thrown in. It was an umbrella term for big, delicious, spicy, sticky and umami. Sekkoya, however, serves large plates of chicken udon, pork ribs in “Japanese-style bbq sauce” and truffle soy rib eye, and makes you think that someone here is deliberately diluting pan-Asian hits and serving them in their safest possible form. It’s the sort of Asian food that was invented for British people and that you’d get at a Cantonese restaurant in Braintree in 1994.I had hoped that my main course of masala cod would be the moment things turned around, but its green marinade tasted of precisely nothing: no garlic, no ginger, no chilli, no coriander – nothing. I sought refuge in the pickles that came with it, and relished every second of their mild, vinegary zing. I’d decided against eating this with chips, so went for one of the only other suitable side options, steamed rice, which was totally unseasoned, but there was a lot of it and it did come in a lovely bowl.“Is it worth looking at the dessert menu?” I asked our server. “Oh yes, it’s very exciting,” came the reply, with what I couldn’t be sure was a straight face. It featured ice-cream and sorbet, yuzu cheesecake, chocolate brownie and those bought-in mochi rice-cake ice-cream balls that pan-Asian restaurants often serve as their only dessert to bore you into leaving early because they want to turn your table. Ha! They wouldn’t shake me off that easily here, and my mango mochi ice-cream ball was the loveliest thing I ate that day; Sekkoya serves them with vanilla ice-cream. Gosh, this is some menu writing, but Sekkoya is sort-of-Asian, and the food’s definitely cooked in a pan, so, technically, they’re not lying.Sekkoya The Riverside, Kingsmead Road, Canterbury, Kent, 01227 286221.

I am 41 now and I think this has really affected me throughout my whole life. He always picked on me, called me stupid, fat, ugly, worthless and told me that I was never good at anything. This went on every day until I moved abroad to live with my grandmother at the age of 17.My parents never made me feel protected and never punished him or made him stop. I resent them for it and feel let down by them. I’ve spoken to my mum a few times in recent years, but it’s a bit too late now and I don’t want to make her feel guilty when she can’t turn back time.My brother’s life isn’t easy now. He is in a difficult marriage and has a child with additional needs. Our relationship is not great and we don’t live in the same country, so we only see each other (always around family) maybe once or twice a year. I feel sad that we are not close, but at the same time I don’t think things can be improved because of his complicated life circumstances. I also resent him and I feel sad that I was subjected to this treatment for so many years and that it has really affected me.I am not sure if I need therapy to move past it. How can I move forward?. You don’t discuss what your brother is like to you now, only that you are “not close”. One of the most useful things I ever learned was that siblings act out how they feel, and can project any resentment and feelings of inadequacy on to a (usually) younger sibling. So all those things he called you was probably how he felt at the time. Does it make it any better? Not really: you still had to endure it. But I find context, in family history especially, is useful to see things as less personal.Many parents don’t see the abuse between siblings that is happening right under their eyes, either because they think it’s normal or they don’t recognise it. Yet sibling bullying, as you have seen, not only happens but has profound effects. It was the responsibility of your parents to manage your childhood sibling relationships, so I don’t blame you for feeling angry with them. Standing by and doing nothing would have compounded how you felt; one of the hallmarks of trauma is feeling isolated.I am not sure how much you can build on your relationship with your brother – I would not want you to be hurt more. He is really the one who should be building bridges and saying sorry.I went to UKCP-registered John Cavanagh, who works extensively with families. “Years of being called those things is emotional abuse – of course it would have affected your identity. You were also seeing how authority was dealt with, or not. If you didn’t see your parents stand up for you, then you would have thought it’s OK to be treated like this. Silence in this situation is violence.”. Cavanagh felt it would be helpful to talk to your parents: “Saying how you feel is part of the healing.” It’s not really about how they can’t turn back time, but about your experience, one hopes, being validated and heard. As for feeling guilty: remember, we often feel guilty when others aren’t doing the work they should in a situation. You have nothing to feel guilty about.Cavanagh and I discussed how wonderful it would be if your whole family could have family therapy, but I know this is a rare thing, perhaps even rarer that everyone takes responsibility for their own behaviour. I absolutely think you would benefit from your own therapy.Cavanagh said: “If you’ve learned your place in the world through negative language, there is no miracle cure to undo years of abuse. But I wonder if you could start to think about your relationship to praise: how do you respond to it? Do you bat it away, or really allow it to sink in and start to believe you are good enough; you are worthy of love.”. Sign up to Inside Saturday.

Please seek out some longer-term therapy, and hopefully you have good people around you who reflect you as you really are. Personally, I would attend to my own boundaries first, before approaching family. They don’t define you any more. You do.

A week in western Slovenia offers everything you could want from a European road trip – breathtaking mountain views, easy hops between stops and, maybe most importantly, scenic but well-maintained roads. Pick up a car in Ljubljana, head north to the lakes of Bled and Bohinj, then wind slowly south, via the vinicultural Vipava valley, to the caves and cliffside castles of Postojna. Finally, end your trip in the coastal town of Piran for an open-air spa day on the salt flats of the Sečovlje Salina nature park, and a view of the glittering Adriatic sea, with a glass of Slovenian wine in hand.Holly R.

My trip by motorcycle from Lake Como in Italy to Lake Constance (Bodensee) in Germany over the wonderfully twisty Splügen Pass was fantastic. Setting off in bright sunlight with the scent of wisteria in the air, up and over the pass with its road signs beginning with Tornante (hairpin bend) moving on to Due tornanti (two hairpin bends) and finally warning you of Molti Tornanti as the winding road up the steep mountainside comes fearfully into view. Down into Switzerland along sweeping curves, through the micro state of Liechtenstein in just 30 minutes or so, clipping a corner of Austria and on into Germany. A late afternoon arrival in Immenstaad on the shores of Lake Constance and an opportunity to sample the local wine in celebration of a great bike ride was perfection. Five countries in five hours.Stephen Shaw. In Cyprus’s Troodos mountains, after driving on the scary mountain roads, we ran out of petrol in the middle of a village on a Sunday morning. The villagers knocked on doors to wake up the man who operated the petrol pump, while we were served cheese snacks and black coffees. They wouldn’t accept our offers of money, so we bought literally all of their tomatoes! Piled into the back I remember tears of laughter as to what we were going to do with them all. Best trip ever.Zoe. After navigating the Montenegrin coastal roads, we decided to cycle inland into mountainous Bosnia-Herzegovina. After a border crossing at almost 1,000 metres above sea level, we descended into a beautiful country with wide plains and empty roads. Enjoying a section of the Ćiro Trail, a former railway route converted into a bicycle path – we enjoyed the spectacular 100-mile journey on the mountain-hugging paved roads into Mostar. The nine-day road trip through Bosnia-Herzegovina was memorable – a juxtaposition of beauty and war – a diverse landscape dotted with a scarred past evident with its landmine signs, gun-shelled houses and verdant valleys.Gwen Sim. After a day’s sightseeing in Munich we headed south to Ötztal in Austria. Here we stayed at Hotel Stern for the night then hiked up to Farst at 1,450 metres to take in the views. After that we relaxed at Aqua Dome, floating in its heavenly outdoor pools as the moon peeked behind the mountains. On the next leg, we took the Timmelsjoch high alpine road (May-Oct) and crossed into Italy at nearly 2,500 metres, staying overnight at Albergo Hochfirst, high in the mountains with stunning views. The following day we headed west and entered Switzerland in Müstair, admiring the wonderful Unesco-listed Benedictine Abbey of St John. At Davos, 50 miles further west, we took the Schatzalpbahn funicular railway to 1,800 metres and enjoyed a breathtaking panorama and an invigorating walk. Then we drove along the shores of Walensee and Zürichsee into Zurich, where we visited museums and strolled around taking in Swiss culture, history and architecture. Our final stop before heading back to Munich was at Lindau on Lake Constance, where we sat in a quaint beer garden under chestnut trees, gazing at the soaring Alps on the other side of the lake.Marei.

Our road trip started in Zagreb, which is great value and still has amazing foodie finds. Our next port of call was the stunning Plitvice Lakes national park, with its waterfalls and forests, before a beautiful 120-mile stretch of road to Skradin, a hidden sailing town gem, and a perfect base for heading out to Krka national park to enjoy more rivers and waterfalls. Next up was Split, where we took in views of the old town from the 12th-century bell tower of St Domnius Cathedral. We also took a relaxing boat trip to Hvar from Split. Back in the hire car we headed 150 miles south to crowded but utterly beautiful Dubrovnik – also a great place for eating out.Sophie. La Garde-Freinet is a well-preserved medieval village with a fascinating history about 10 miles inland from Saint-Tropez. The hairy roads and mountainous terrain have helped the area avoid the tourist saturation of the coast. When I was a teenager, we drove these mountain roads, eyeing the beautiful scenery and trusting my parents’ driving ability to navigate cliff edges and dust tracks. The village is absolutely worth the edgy drive. The beautiful stone houses, the deep chestnut and cork forests and the distant outline of the Alpes-Maritimes will capture any heart.Sarah. An Italian ice-cream seller told me a less crowded, equally spectacular road trip alternative to the Amalfi coast last summer: the evocatively named Violet Coast road in Calabria. Inspired by his praise, we headed south 260 miles from Naples in our camper – to the Capo Vaticano peninsula on a road of dramatic cliffs on one side tumbling down to soft sandy beaches and sensual cerulean sunsets on the other. I had to concentrate on keeping my eyes on the road so I stopped at the town of Tropea for an energising coffee. I carried on along narrow streets zigzagging their way past ancient castles and villas with the mountains of the Aspromonte national park in the distance until another break at the pretty village of Pizzo. More coffee and a view of the volcanoes of Stromboli (from Tropea) and Etna (from Lazzaro) drew me ever farther south before heading back to Naples via Siderno and Catanzaro.Will. As one of a group of surfers I took the ferry from Plymouth to Roscoff and drove down the west coast of France to San Sebastián, just over the Spanish border, stopping along the way to surf the amazing breaks and eat some fantastic food. Highlights include the awe-inspiring Dune du Pilat (Europe’s biggest sand dune), eating fresh moules-frites by the port in Hossegor, and chipirons à la plancha (tiny fried squid from the Basque region) with a cold beer watching the sun go down in Guéthary. San Sebastián proved as wonderful as its reputation suggested: a beautiful city full of more gastronomic and architectural delights.Sarah D The last tip was amended on 26 April 2024. The ferry was from Plymouth to Roscoff, not Saint-Malo, as a previous version said."
