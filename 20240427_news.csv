Elite force bucks trend of Ukrainian losses on eastern front,"<p>The Azov brigade, which leaders say has a culture of ‘mutual respect’, is tasked with repelling relentless Russian attacks as the invaders make most of artillery mismatch</p><p>Fifteen miles east of the garrison town of Lyman, a desperate fight has been taking place on Ukraine’s eastern front for months. The once verdant <a href=""https://x.com/DefenceU/status/1783064243060756850"">Serebryansky pine forest</a> has been reduced to burnt-out stumps, reminiscent of images from the Somme, destroyed amid Russian attacks aimed at eliminating Ukrainian foxholes.</p><p>Fearful that the frontline could crack last summer, Ukraine’s commanders deployed the Azov infantry brigade to the sector. Their task was and is to repel what “Maslo”, a 29-year-old staff sergeant with the unit’s first battalion, described as “constant assaults, every day, sometimes for 24 hours”.

‘These people matter’: why Diana Matar photographs the sites where US police have killed civilians,"<p>The celebrated US photographer’s haunting new series, documenting the locations where people have died in encounters with police, is a quietly devastating commemoration and a critique of modern American culture</p><p>In their monochrome starkness, Diana Matar’s images of modern America possess a melancholic undertow that is both familiar and unsettling.

Rick Astley: ‘I’m boring away from the spotlight – that’s why my life works’,"<p>The singer, 58, on staying sane, why he isn’t afraid of getting his hands dirty and how the internet gave his most famous song a new lease of life</p><p><strong>Being </strong><strong>10 years</strong> younger than my older siblings meant I was bombarded with music from a young age. My older sister, Jane, and brother, John, played records relentlessly. My sister was obsessed with Motown, but also prog rock. The first band I ever saw live was Supertramp.<br><br><strong>My dad ran</strong> a little garden centre and it made me realise that if you run your own business, you can run your own life. I inherited his work ethic. We all worked at his garden centre after school and at weekends. I was never frightened of getting my hands dirty, often literally.<br><br><strong>My parents divorced</strong> when I was five and it had a huge impact on me. We lived at my dad’s house for a bit, because my mum had a breakdown. She had five children in total. The middle one, David, died of meningitis. I think she’d had enough and went to live at my grandma’s. The whole experience left me scarred. It made me realise anything can happen at any time and you can’t even rely on the biggest thing you want to count on: your parents being there for you.<br><br><strong>The internet gave</strong> Never Gonna Give You Up a second life. There’s a generation of people whose kids are saying to them, “Oh, I love this tune,” and the parents are going, “How do you even know who this bloke is?”<br><br><strong><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/dec/31/rick-astley-80s-pop-idol-bbc-new-year-special-star-meme"">Singing on stage</a></strong><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/dec/31/rick-astley-80s-pop-idol-bbc-new-year-special-star-meme""> with Foo Fighters</a> was surreal. The first time it happened was at a festival in Japan. Dave Grohl had seen I was on the bill on another stage and, when they were playing, suddenly invited me on to sing Never Gonna Give You Up. I was a bit jet lagged and I’d had a few beers. Then I’m singing my song in front of tens of thousands of people.<br><br><strong>I’m pretty boring</strong> away from the spotlight, but that’s why my life works. When I’m in the spotlight, I’m full of adrenaline and emotion. When I’m off stage, my favourite thing to do is to go for a walk.</p><p><strong>My ambition</strong> for the future is to remain sane. Seriously. My plan to achieve this is by doing less. <br><br><strong>One of the pitfalls</strong> of a pop career is that you do something exciting and then think, “We have to do it again – but with more lights.” Some artists can do that. Others need to take stock. I think one of the keys to sanity is having a sense of perspective. It can’t all be Glastonbury. <br><br><strong>I can guarantee</strong> that Never Gonna Give You Up will not be played at my funeral. I certainly won’t be playing it and I don’t think anyone else will be playing it either. I don’t even know if I want to be remembered. I think the music almost lives in its own world. I’d prefer to be remembered for being a decent person.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/apr/27/rick-astley-im-boring-away-from-the-spotlight-thats-why-my-life-works"">Continue reading...</a>",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/apr/27/rick-astley-im-boring-away-from-the-spotlight-thats-why-my-life-works,2024-04-27 13:00:35

Who would’ve thought booking a table would require superhuman strength | Rachel Cooke,"<p>In New York, ‘reservation scalpers’ are making $80,000 a year, but I’m banking on a neighbour’s generosity </p><p>The land of restaurants is increasingly paradoxical. Every day, good ones close. Running costs are punitive and broke customers are eating at home more often. Yet still there are places where it’s next to impossible to bag a table; where to have even the remotest chance of doing so requires near superhuman levels of patience and determination, as well as no other demands whatsoever on your time – including paid employment.</p><p>I laughed when I read in the <em>New Yorker</em>’s annual food issue of the “<a href=""https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13345037/nyc-restaurant-reservation-scalper-backlash-booking.html"">reservation scalpers</a>” who make $80,000 a year by hoarding bookings to then sell them on to the desperate-to-be-there rich. Only in Manhattan, I thought. But this didn’t stop me. Just moments later, I was urging my neighbour, Sue, who is to restaurants what Harry Houdini once was to padlocks and straitjackets – just you watch her bust her way in! – to try to get us a table at&nbsp;X (I won’t say its name, for obvious reasons). Sue is also a hoarder of reservations, with the key difference that she then shares them with (I&nbsp;flatter myself) beloved friends at no extra charge. So now we’re on tenterhooks, waiting and hoping – and hoping and waiting – for the hottest Sunday lunch in town.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/apr/27/joy-friend-superpower-getting-a-table-at-the-hottest-restaurants-rachel-cooke"">Continue reading...</a>",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/apr/27/joy-friend-superpower-getting-a-table-at-the-hottest-restaurants-rachel-cooke,2024-04-27 15:00:38

Moderating horror and hate on the web may be beyond even AI | John Naughton,"<p>Managing the barrage of upsetting material online is a challenge that service providers are struggling to meet, even if they try</p><p>Way back in the mid-1990s, when the web was young and the online world was buzzing with blogs, a worrying problem loomed. If you were an ISP that hosted blogs, and one of them contained material that was illegal or defamatory, you could be held legally responsible and sued into bankruptcy. Fearing that this would dramatically slow the expansion of a vital technology, two US lawmakers, Chris Cox and Ron Wyden, inserted 26 words into the Communications Decency Act of 1996, which eventually became <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_230"">section 230</a><strong> </strong>of the Telecommunications Act of the same year. The words in question were: “No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.” The <a href=""https://muse.jhu.edu/book/68383"">implications were profound</a>: from now on you bore no liability for content published on your platform.</p><p>The result was the exponential increase in user-generated content on the internet. The problem was that some of that content was vile, defamatory or downright horrible. Even if it was, though, the hosting site bore no liability for it. At times, some of that content caused public outrage to the point where it became a PR problem for the platforms hosting it and they began engaging in “moderation”.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/apr/27/silicon-valleys-business-model-is-incompatible-with-the-moderation-of-online-horror-and-hatred"">Continue reading...</a>",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/apr/27/silicon-valleys-business-model-is-incompatible-with-the-moderation-of-online-horror-and-hatred,2024-04-27 15:00:39
The overturning of Harvey Weinstein’s rape conviction is an affront to women | Moira Donegan,"<p>#MeToo’s real legacy may not be ending predators’ impunity so much as highlighting the tenacity of that impunity</p><p>Usually, rape isn’t reported. When it is reported, it is often not charged. And when it is charged, it rarely leads to a conviction. These facts shape both our cultural understanding of sexual violence and women’s sense of their own embodied lives, clarifying something many of us already know – that while sexual violence is technically illegal and officially abhorred, it is also tolerated in practice, with actual arrests and convictions being so rare that most sexual violence is de facto decriminalized.</p><p>Only occasionally does a notable rape conviction come to pass; when it does, its very rarity highlights this dissonance, making plain the gulf between how rape is officially talked about and how it is usually treated. Now, that gulf has come to the fore again, because on Thursday one of the most high-profile rape convictions in American history was overturned.</p><p>Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/apr/27/harvey-weinstein-conviction-overturned-me-too"">Continue reading...</a>",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/apr/27/harvey-weinstein-conviction-overturned-me-too,2024-04-27 10:01:31

"Knuckles review – Idris Elba’s Sonic spin-off is ludicrous, hilarious and actually rather moving","<p>The further this show leans into its silly side, the better it becomes. It is about an echidna space warrior helping his pal get to a bowling tournament, after all</p><p>Giving a supporting character their own spin-off is a risky business. For every brilliant series such as Better Call Saul, Frasier or Angel (series one, two, three and five), there’s a grave miscalculation in the form of a Joey, The Book of Boba Fett or Angel (series four). After the runaway success of the Sonic films, which have a third instalment on the way, Paramount+ has selected Knuckles, the steely echidna, for the spin-off treatment – and for all the brazen product placement and IP cash-grabbing, it’s a risk that pays off.</p><p>Idris Elba reprises his role from Sonic the Hedgehog 2 , as a hot-tempered and self-serious red echidna warrior from space who, as we are frequently reminded, is the last of his kind after an owl-led genocide took his home planet. Having been briefly tricked by Doctor Robotnik (a thankfully absent scenery-chewing Jim Carrey) to fight for the bad guys in the previous film, he has now teamed up with Sonic and Tails and moved in with the Wachowskis (Tika Sumpter and a puzzlingly absent James Marsden). This set-up is not going especially well as the series begins, due to Knuckles’s tendency to start the day by punching boulders and attempting to train the “wolf” (actually a docile labrador) to be a fierce warrior. With all the smashed walls and echinadian fighting rituals, Knuckles finds himself grounded. But he soon defies the punishment to hit the road with Wade Whipple (Adam Pally), a hapless but sweet-natured deputy sheriff, to help him become a bowling champion. Naturally, as this is a Sonic spin-off there’s also some fighting to be done and Knuckles and Wade find themselves pursued by two former G.U.N agents played by Kid Cudi and British comedian Ellie Taylor.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/apr/27/knuckles-review-idris-elbas-sonic-spin-off-is-ludicrous-hilarious-and-actually-rather-moving"">Continue reading...</a>",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/apr/27/knuckles-review-idris-elbas-sonic-spin-off-is-ludicrous-hilarious-and-actually-rather-moving,2024-04-27 05:00:27
Ask Ottolenghi: what’s the best way to get a garlicky flavour into tomato pasta sauce?,"<p>The answer, surprisingly, is not just to use more garlic (but you can go to town with the basil)</p><ul><li><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/jan/17/ask-ottolenghi-send-in-your-kitchen-questions"">Ask Ottolenghi: send in your kitchen questions</a></li></ul><p><strong>How can we get a pleasingly strong garlic taste in our tomato sauce for pasta? Is the secret the amount of garlic</strong><strong>, or how you cut it</strong><strong>, or the </strong><strong>length of cooking? </strong><strong>Our sauces tend to </strong><strong>be bland</strong><strong> rather than zingy</strong><strong>. The same </strong><strong>goes for basil, in the same simple sauce – how to highlight its flavour? </strong><strong> </strong><em><strong><br>Nancy, New York</strong></em><br>I trust that’s pleasingly strong as opposed to harshly strong? If so, slow-roasting would be my initial go-to. Don’t turn on the oven just for this, though, but next time you have it on, cut the very top off a head of garlic, just to expose the cloves, drizzle over a little olive oil, then wrap in tin foil and pop it in the bottom of the oven for about 45 minutes. Remove and, once cool enough to handle, squeeze out the now amazingly soft and sweet garlic flesh, and stir it into your tomato sauce. The chains of fructose in the garlic will have broken down during roasting and given rise to something called glutamic acid, which brings with it that bold umami taste and depth we all look for in a sauce. In short, you’ll have created the most mellow but bold, sweet and pleasingly strong burst of garlicky flavour.</p><p>If you’ve not had time to roast it, it’s also fine to start with raw garlic. The more you mince it, the more the flavour compounds are released and the stronger the flavour will be, so crush or finely mince it, rather than slice it, if you want that garlic flavour really to penetrate the sauce.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/apr/27/ask-ottolenghi-whats-the-best-way-to-get-a-garlicky-flavour-into-tomato-pasta-sauce"">Continue reading...</a>",https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/apr/27/ask-ottolenghi-whats-the-best-way-to-get-a-garlicky-flavour-into-tomato-pasta-sauce,2024-04-27 07:29:28

"‘Dismissing global warming? That was a joke’: Jeremy Clarkson on fury, farming and why he’s a changed man","<p>The former Top Gear presenter claims his controversialist persona was just a caricature, and he’s really a reformed character living the good life. But do old habits die hard?</p><p>“Are you happy?” I ask Jeremy Clarkson. A few times on Clarkson’s Farm, you said were happy. His thick eyebrows seem low, like storm clouds gathering. “I said that in season one, episode one,” he replies. “And I meant it then. Lockdown was a blessed relief. You thought: no one’s inviting me out, I don’t have to go anywhere. Lisa would say, ‘Let’s go on holiday again next weekend.’ And I could say, ‘No! We can’t!’ It was brilliant. We were stuck here. So I was very happy at work then.” Didn’t he say he was happy at another point, while building his pigpen or sowing on his tractor? He looks at me, eyebrows locking, lips pursed in thought. He has perfect recall of the entire Clarkson’s Farm archive. He was pleased when he did those things, but it wasn’t a blanket expression of happiness. Pleased? “Well, what did I do for 25 years? I drove around corners shouting and achieved nothing. Nothing! And then you plant a field of mustard, which I did last year, and some of it grew. Not as much as I’d been hoping, but some. So you have a sense of achievement.”</p><p>Could we allow for the possibility that he might be <em>contented</em>, then? Clarkson concedes that springtime is nice. “This is going to sound awfully pretentious, but I’ve never noticed the buds coming on the trees before. I spent a good 20 minutes yesterday staring at buds, going, is that too early? Or is that later than normal?”</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/apr/27/jeremy-clarkson-interview-global-warming-fury-farming"">Continue reading...</a>",https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/apr/27/jeremy-clarkson-interview-global-warming-fury-farming,2024-04-27 06:00:27

‘Demolishing democracy’: how much danger does Christian nationalism pose?,"<p>Documentary Bad Faith looks at the history of a group trying to affect and corrupt politics under the guise of religion</p><p>Bad Faith, a new documentary on the rise of Christian nationalism in the United States, opens with an obvious, ominous scene – the storming of the Capitol on 6 January 2021 – though trained on details drowned out by the deluge of horror and easily recognizable images of chaos. That Paula White, Donald Trump’s faith adviser, led the Save America rally in a prayer to overturn the results for “a free and fair election”.

Dyeing art: Ptolemy Mann’s vibrant thread paintings – in pictures,"<p>“The act of hand weaving and dyeing cloth is extremely labour intensive – it can take months to make one piece,” says British artist Ptolemy Mann, who has been creating textile works of extraordinary colour and vibrancy for nearly 30 years. In 2021, after a period of experimenting with painting on paper, she turned her brush to her painstakingly dyed and handwoven cloths – the striking results can be seen in Mann’s first monograph, <em><a href=""https://hurtwood.co.uk/art/thread-painting/"">Thread Painting</a></em><a href=""https://hurtwood.co.uk/art/thread-painting/""> (published 9 May, Hurtwood Press)</a>, and a solo show at <a href=""https://www.cromwellplace.com/whats-on/ptolemy-mann-thread-painting"">Cromwell Place, London (15-19 May)</a>. “There’s something radical about taking a precious handwoven cloth and applying a wet, loaded paint brush to its surface,” she says, noting that most traditional paintings are done on woven (albeit plain) canvases. “People are astounded that I am willing to take the risk. They love the madness of them.”</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/culture/gallery/2024/apr/27/dyeing-art-ptolemy-manns-vibrant-thread-paintings-in-pictures"">Continue reading...</a>",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/gallery/2024/apr/27/dyeing-art-ptolemy-manns-vibrant-thread-paintings-in-pictures,2024-04-27 16:00:39

PSG and Lyon cast friendships aside before Champions League return,"<p>Respect is mutual between Sakina Karchaoui and Eugénie Le Sommer, but only one of their teams will reach the final </p><p>“There is no friendship on the pitch,” says the Lyon forward Eugénie Le Sommer. Paris Saint-Germain’s full-back Sakina Karchaoui echoes those sentiments: “Before the match and after the match, yes, but during the match? No friends. We cut contact the days before the match, but once the match is over, we love to tease each other depending on the result.”</p><p>For PSG there has been scant opportunity to brag. They have barely dented Lyon’s Division 1 Feminine run of 16 titles, 2021 being the outlier when PSG finished top for the first time.

Safe haven or symbol of injustice? What our gardens tell us about the world we live in,"<p>From manicured, exclusive retreats built on slave money to common ground in which to seed utopian dreams, gardens occupy a fertile space in our lives and imaginations</p><p>I have a dream sometimes. I dream I’m in a house, and discover a door I didn’t know was there. It opens into an unexpected garden, and for a weightless moment I find myself inhabiting new territory, flush with potential. Maybe there are steps down to a pond, or a statue surrounded by fallen leaves. It is never tidy, always beguilingly overgrown. What might grow here, what rare peonies, irises, roses will I find? I wake with the sense that a too-tight joint has loosened, and that everything runs fluent with new life.</p><p>For most of the years that I have had this dream, I didn’t have a garden of my own. I rented until I was 40, and only rarely in flats with outdoor space. The first of these temporary gardens was in Brighton. I planted calendula there, which according to the 16th-century herbalist Gerard would “strengthen and comfort the heart very much”. I was training to be a herbalist and my head was full of plants, an entanglement of natural forms.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/apr/27/safe-haven-or-symbol-of-injustice-what-our-gardens-tell-us-about-the-world-we-live-in"">Continue reading...</a>",https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/apr/27/safe-haven-or-symbol-of-injustice-what-our-gardens-tell-us-about-the-world-we-live-in,2024-04-27 08:00:29

"40 years of comedy classic Auf Wiedersehen, Pet: ‘The producers thought it was too crude, too manly’","<p>It’s four decades since the comedy drama detailing the exploits of British migrant workers in Germany burst on to our screens. As they stage a live show, its writers and stars let us in on how they constructed a classic</p><p>In November 1983, a new television series that focused on working-class labourers debuted on ITV. Auf Wiedersehen, Pet told the story of seven men who felt it necessary to leave their families and Thatcher’s Britain in order to earn a living wage. Dennis Patterson (Tim Healy), Neville Hope (Kevin Whately), Leonard “Oz” Osborne (Jimmy Nail), Barry Taylor (Timothy Spall), Wayne Norris (Gary Holton), Albert Moxey (Christopher Fairbank) and Brian “Bomber” Busbridge (Pat Roach) were, between them, brickies, electricians and carpenters who lived and worked together on a construction site in Düsseldorf, Germany, where they bonded, pined for home and drank away their sorrows. Mostly written by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, and performed by a cast of young actors, it proved an immediate hit, and helped launch its leads, who went on to careers in film, theatre and music.</p><p>The show immediately hit a collective nerve. Like&nbsp;Alan Bleasdale’s Boys from the Black Stuff the previous year – which covered similar themes of high unemployment and the spectre of a bleak future – Auf&nbsp;Wiedersehen, Pet also managed to be funny. It quickly gained weekly audience figures of around 14 million. It has perhaps gone on to endure so well because, by focusing on the complicated business of male friendship with the suggestion that beneath all the bluff and the bravado their love for one another ran deep, it was ahead of its time.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/apr/27/aufwiedersehen-pet-40-years-franc-roddam-clement-lafrenais-tim-healy"">Continue reading...</a>",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/apr/27/aufwiedersehen-pet-40-years-franc-roddam-clement-lafrenais-tim-healy,2024-04-27 10:55:32

But TikTok videos made by impassioned fans vaulted the American author to a new level of fame.

Elaha review – sensitive drama exploring taboos in a tight-knit German-Kurdish community,"<p>A magnetic central performance from Bayan Layla as a young woman balancing cultural identity and female sexuality lights up Milena Aboyan’s fine debut feature</p><p>“I wish we had German vaginas.” On a stolen evening at a nightclub, away from the gaze of their families, Elaha (Bayan Layla) and her friends finally feel free enough to say the unsayable. The girls may have been born and raised in Germany, but they are part of a tight-knit German-Kurdish community that has certain expectations about how a young woman should behave. Sex before marriage, for example, is forbidden. Elaha’s mother (Derya Durmaz) claims that she would rather her daughter was dead than deflowered. Which is a problem for Elaha, who is covertly and urgently researching the options for surgical hymen reconstruction in advance of her marriage to a handsome, charming but deeply conservative Kurdish man.</p><p>The taboos around sex are deeply entrenched. While Elaha knows that her best friend is sexually active, she would never dream of broaching the subject outright. She finds a confidante elsewhere, in her serene and heavily pregnant teacher (Hadnet Tesfai), who suggests that questions of “honour” are less important than the fundamental issue: “Are you the woman you want to be?”</p><p>In UK and Irish cinemas now</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/apr/27/elaha-review-sensitive-drama-exploring-taboos-in-a-tight-knit-german-kurdish-community"">Continue reading...</a>",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/apr/27/elaha-review-sensitive-drama-exploring-taboos-in-a-tight-knit-german-kurdish-community,2024-04-27 14:00:37
Paraorchestra: Death Songbook live review – bittersweet ballads with Brett Anderson and friends,"<p><strong>Roundhouse, London<br></strong>Charles Hazlewood’s boundary-breaking ensemble guide the Suede singer and special guests through an elegiac evening grown out of the pandemic</p><p>Dressed all in black, Brett Anderson is channelling the elliptical yearning of Echo and the Bunnymen’s 1984 song <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgTH3_v4_c4"">The Killing Moon</a>. To his left, Paraorchestra percussionist Harriet Riley conjures a moody ache out of double-bowed vibraphone keys. Surfing atop currents of orchestral strings are flutes, whose trilling potential is kept in check here – this post-punk anthem requires a ghostly keen rather than anything more florid. On classical guitar, Paraorchestra’s Tony Remy is equally restrained, allowing himself some Spanish-tinged latitude only towards the end.</p><p>The Paraorchestra’s musical director, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/feb/07/charles-hazlewood-beethoven-and-me-interview-paraorchestra"">Charles Hazlewood</a>, meanwhile, dapper of moustache, plays several instruments, often at once, and still has hands left over to lead the ensemble.

The week in classical: Lucia di Lammermoor; Nash Ensemble; Anthony McGill and Kaleidoscope Chamber Collective – review,"<p><strong>Royal Opera House; Wigmore Hall; Milton Court, London<br></strong>A fearless central performance anchors Katie Mitchell’s busy yet insightful Donizetti revival. And two chamber concerts serve as a vibrant prelude to this year’s BBC Proms…</p><p>“Agency” is a current buzzword in opera, well-worn but still valid and usually preceded by “female”. Women, abused, controlled, dying, were long assumed to have no free will. A radical rethink, of history in its entirety, and of opera, has put this expectation in the dock. One of the sharpest cross-questioners, scrutinising every hardened attitude, is the British director <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/nov/24/german-theatre-director-katie-mitchell"">Katie Mitchell</a>, whose work has been seen (alternative wording: “has divided audiences”) across Europe since the mid-1990s.</p><p>Her production of Gaetano Donizetti’s <strong><a href=""https://www.roh.org.uk/tickets-and-events/lucia-di-lammermoor-by-katie-mitchell-details"">Lucia di Lammermoor</a></strong> (1835), as troublesome as it is unnerving and perceptive, has returned to the Royal Opera House for a second revival. The soprano <a href=""https://www.roh.org.uk/people/nadine-sierra"">Nadine Sierra</a> excels in the title role (her fellow American <a href=""https://livredpath.com/"">Liv Redpath</a> will give three performances).

On Resistance Street review – punkish record of music’s long battle with racism,"<p>The Clash are the touchstone for a story that stretches back to the 50s, told in interviews with many campaigning rockers</p><p>There’s no better time than now for a documentary on popular music’s role in the fight against racism and fascism. And in true punk spirit, this lo-fi indie packs in a lot of history and righteous passion for not much budget – even if, to be brutally honest, its core narrative is a very minor part of that history, centred on a bunch of ageing Clash fans.</p><p>The Clash are very much the touchstone here. Motivated by musicians such as Eric Clapton echoing the National Front’s racist and anti-immigrant sentiments, Joe Strummer and co became key players in the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/06/rock-against-racism-book-syd-shelton-clash"">Rock Against Racism</a> movement in the late 70s, alongside acts including Steel Pulse, Tom Robinson and Aswad.

"St Vincent: All Born Screaming review – magnificently dark, heavy and loud","<p>(Total Pleasure/Virgin)<br>Recreating the noises in her head, Annie Clark’s first fully self-produced album ranges across styles and emotions, and is her most direct yet</p><p>Worth remembering: Annie “St Vincent” Clark’s college band was called <a href=""https://www.esquire.com/uk/culture/a60368237/st-vincent-interview-all-born-screaming/"">the Skull Fuckers</a>. The guitarist is no stranger to coaxing hairy sounds out of her instrument, nor to drilling down to uncouth feelings within. After a series of albums with slicker sound palettes, she has gone dark and heavy for her seventh studio , <em><a href=""https://link.fans/st-vincent"">All Born Screaming</a></em>; heavy-hitter Dave Grohl plays apocalyptic drums on a pair of tracks. Clark’s first entirely self-produced work, it aims to recreate the noises in her head without a filter. Gloriously unstable modular synths often figure. Apparently it took dozens of vocal takes to strike the right timbre of desolation on Hell Is Near, the bleak first cut.</p><p>At the other end of the record, the title track highlights the suffering in the human condition – and simultaneously, the fact that the pain means we’re alive. In between, Clark touches on lust, loss and death in a more direct manner than her highly stylised personae often allow for. From the noisy low end of lead track Broken Man, through <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E65yRApR9UU"">Flea</a>’s prowling industrial pop and the superlative goth jazz, Bond-like theme of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtY1vRh7QwQ"">Violent Times</a>, it’s a loud and unapologetically varied work.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/apr/27/st-vincent-all-born-screaming-review-magnificently-dark-heavy-and-loud"">Continue reading...</a>",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/apr/27/st-vincent-all-born-screaming-review-magnificently-dark-heavy-and-loud,2024-04-27 10:00:34
"Knuckles review – Idris Elba’s Sonic spin-off is ludicrous, hilarious and actually rather moving","<p>The further this show leans into its silly side, the better it becomes. It is about an echidna space warrior helping his pal get to a bowling tournament, after all</p><p>Giving a supporting character their own spin-off is a risky business. For every brilliant series such as Better Call Saul, Frasier or Angel (series one, two, three and five), there’s a grave miscalculation in the form of a Joey, The Book of Boba Fett or Angel (series four). After the runaway success of the Sonic films, which have a third instalment on the way, Paramount+ has selected Knuckles, the steely echidna, for the spin-off treatment – and for all the brazen product placement and IP cash-grabbing, it’s a risk that pays off.</p><p>Idris Elba reprises his role from Sonic the Hedgehog 2 , as a hot-tempered and self-serious red echidna warrior from space who, as we are frequently reminded, is the last of his kind after an owl-led genocide took his home planet. Having been briefly tricked by Doctor Robotnik (a thankfully absent scenery-chewing Jim Carrey) to fight for the bad guys in the previous film, he has now teamed up with Sonic and Tails and moved in with the Wachowskis (Tika Sumpter and a puzzlingly absent James Marsden). This set-up is not going especially well as the series begins, due to Knuckles’s tendency to start the day by punching boulders and attempting to train the “wolf” (actually a docile labrador) to be a fierce warrior. With all the smashed walls and echinadian fighting rituals, Knuckles finds himself grounded. But he soon defies the punishment to hit the road with Wade Whipple (Adam Pally), a hapless but sweet-natured deputy sheriff, to help him become a bowling champion. Naturally, as this is a Sonic spin-off there’s also some fighting to be done and Knuckles and Wade find themselves pursued by two former G.U.N agents played by Kid Cudi and British comedian Ellie Taylor.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/apr/27/knuckles-review-idris-elbas-sonic-spin-off-is-ludicrous-hilarious-and-actually-rather-moving"">Continue reading...</a>",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/apr/27/knuckles-review-idris-elbas-sonic-spin-off-is-ludicrous-hilarious-and-actually-rather-moving,2024-04-27 05:00:27

The first time it happened was at a festival in Japan. Dave Grohl had seen I was on the bill on another stage and, when they were playing, suddenly invited me on to sing Never Gonna Give You Up. I was a bit jet lagged and I’d had a few beers. Then I’m singing my song in front of tens of thousands of people.<br><br><strong>I’m pretty boring</strong> away from the spotlight, but that’s why my life works. When I’m in the spotlight, I’m full of adrenaline and emotion. When I’m off stage, my favourite thing to do is to go for a walk.</p><p><strong>My ambition</strong> for the future is to remain sane. Seriously. My plan to achieve this is by doing less. <br><br><strong>One of the pitfalls</strong> of a pop career is that you do something exciting and then think, “We have to do it again – but with more lights.” Some artists can do that.

‘A sense of wonder enveloped my mother and me’: Mishal Husain on her eye-opening journey through Uzbekistan in search of an ancestor,"<p>The broadcaster knew she had a link to the central Asian country she first visited on her gap year 30 years ago. But retracing her steps, this time with her mother in tow, she made a big discovery about their family</p><p>‘Can you read what it says?” It was 1992 and I was standing in Samarkand’s impressive Registan Square, looking up at Arabic inscriptions on 15th- and 17th-century buildings, when an Uzbek man approached me, speaking in Russian. The Soviet Union had just collapsed, but he had lived his life in a period when Cyrillic script had been dominant and Islamic learning discouraged. Now, seeing a stranger trying to decipher the words on the buildings of his city, he wanted to know if I could explain them to him.</p><p>Back then, I was on my gap year and living in Moscow teaching English at a specialist language school, where many of my pupils were the children of officials, diplomats and – almost certainly – KGB agents. It was a time of political transition and widespread hardship, including rising prices and struggles to access food, even through the black market. The six of us who had come from the UK were largely protected from that, as whatever we had from home was in sterling, precious hard currency, rather than roubles. When the school had a spring holiday that March, we decided to fly nearly 2,000 miles south-east and see something of Uzbekistan, then emerging from decades as one of the Soviet socialist republics.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2024/apr/27/mishal-husain-journey-through-uzbekistan-in-search-of-an-ancestor"">Continue reading...</a>",https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2024/apr/27/mishal-husain-journey-through-uzbekistan-in-search-of-an-ancestor,2024-04-27 10:00:34

"Grilled onions with eggs, and chive bread pudding: Yotam Ottolenghi’s recipes for alliums","<p>A grilled salad of onions and shallots with boiled eggs and tarragon yoghurt, and a hearty chive and challah bread pudding</p><p>It’s the oldest trick in the book: get some onions and garlic on the stove, cook them until they’re smelling lovely, and everyone will assume that dinner is just around the corner. One way to fast-track that process is to make those alliums the stars of the show, rather than just a background note. From shallots to spring onions and chives to calçots, onions and garlic are just two players in the vast and varied allium family. Unlike other vegetables, alliums accumulate energy stores in chains of fructose sugars, rather than starch, and cooking transforms them from harsh to super-soft and sweet. So, instead of making everyone think of supper, think of onions themselves <em>as </em>supper!</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/apr/27/grilled-onions-eggs-chive-bread-pudding-yotam-ottolenghi-recipes-for-alliums-onions"">Continue reading...</a>",https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/apr/27/grilled-onions-eggs-chive-bread-pudding-yotam-ottolenghi-recipes-for-alliums-onions,2024-04-27 07:00:28
Ask Ottolenghi: what’s the best way to get a garlicky flavour into tomato pasta sauce?,"<p>The answer, surprisingly, is not just to use more garlic (but you can go to town with the basil)</p><ul><li><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/jan/17/ask-ottolenghi-send-in-your-kitchen-questions"">Ask Ottolenghi: send in your kitchen questions</a></li></ul><p><strong>How can we get a pleasingly strong garlic taste in our tomato sauce for pasta? Is the secret the amount of garlic</strong><strong>, or how you cut it</strong><strong>, or the </strong><strong>length of cooking? </strong><strong>Our sauces tend to </strong><strong>be bland</strong><strong> rather than zingy</strong><strong>. The same </strong><strong>goes for basil, in the same simple sauce – how to highlight its flavour? </strong><strong> </strong><em><strong><br>Nancy, New York</strong></em><br>I trust that’s pleasingly strong as opposed to harshly strong? If so, slow-roasting would be my initial go-to. Don’t turn on the oven just for this, though, but next time you have it on, cut the very top off a head of garlic, just to expose the cloves, drizzle over a little olive oil, then wrap in tin foil and pop it in the bottom of the oven for about 45 minutes. Remove and, once cool enough to handle, squeeze out the now amazingly soft and sweet garlic flesh, and stir it into your tomato sauce. The chains of fructose in the garlic will have broken down during roasting and given rise to something called glutamic acid, which brings with it that bold umami taste and depth we all look for in a sauce. In short, you’ll have created the most mellow but bold, sweet and pleasingly strong burst of garlicky flavour.</p><p>If you’ve not had time to roast it, it’s also fine to start with raw garlic. The more you mince it, the more the flavour compounds are released and the stronger the flavour will be, so crush or finely mince it, rather than slice it, if you want that garlic flavour really to penetrate the sauce.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/apr/27/ask-ottolenghi-whats-the-best-way-to-get-a-garlicky-flavour-into-tomato-pasta-sauce"">Continue reading...</a>",https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/apr/27/ask-ottolenghi-whats-the-best-way-to-get-a-garlicky-flavour-into-tomato-pasta-sauce,2024-04-27 07:29:28
Meera Sodha’s vegan recipe for hot sauce doubles with cucumber chutney | The new vegan,"<p>Trini-style soft pillows of fried bread sandwiching spiced chickpeas and served with a punchy cucumber chutney</p><p>Doubles are a delicious and popular Caribbean street food.
