Bryce Dallas Howard: ‘I can’t be trusted around famous people’,"<p>The actor on tricking her tear ducts, being entertained as a child by Tom Cruise and legging it from dinosaurs while wearing stilettos</p><p><strong>Hi Bryce! If two generations makes an acting family, does three make an acting dynasty? [Her father is director Ron Howard, both of whose parents were actors.] </strong><em>JohnHunt<br></em>I think a dynasty is five generations or more, so we’re not even close. We’ve got a way to go. We’ve got three generations, so maybe I’ll be around for it when the Howards cross that threshold.</p><p><strong>When you’re directing something that’s part of a larger collection, </strong><strong>such as </strong><strong>The Mandalorian</strong><strong>, how do you find the balance between maintaining the tone and making something that reflects your own artistic vision? </strong><em>porcospino<br></em>Something like The Mandalorian is such an important story and piece of intellectual property. It’s dramaturgically essential to understand the essence of the creator and what inspired them to create that in the first place, so whatever I’m building on is an extension of their original vision. In the case of Star Wars, it’s George Lucas, but I would feel that way no matter what the material is. It’s very important to have a deep, nuanced, compassionate and objective view when you take the baton.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/apr/25/bryce-dallas-howard-i-cant-be-trusted-around-famous-people"">Continue reading...</a>",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/apr/25/bryce-dallas-howard-i-cant-be-trusted-around-famous-people,2024-04-25 13:00:46
